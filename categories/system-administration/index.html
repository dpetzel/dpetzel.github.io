<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been tasked with migrating a Windows 2003 Small Business Server
to Windows 2013 Standard.</p>

<p>Without getting into too much of the back story, the client purchased Windows
2003 SBS many moons ago, however they never leveraged anything except Active
Directory and File Sharing. They use their hosting provider&rsquo;s web mail, and
don&rsquo;t have an appetite to change that.</p>

<p>Here are we many moons later and they are ready to upgrade. They&rsquo;ve purchased a
new, fairly beefy, box running Windows 2012 Standard.</p>

<p>After some discussions around the path they would prefer to take we&rsquo;ve decided
we don&rsquo;t want to have to touch all of the PCs and move them to a new domain,
and we&rsquo;d like the upgrade to be as seamless as possible. To that end the decision
was made to attempt a <em>migration</em>. This document will hopefully capture my
journey down this path. Its been at least 5 years since I&rsquo;ve touched a &laquo;real&raquo;
domain controller, so a decent amount of reading is order, but from what I have
gathered so far this is not a standard conversion path, but it appears there
are some options.</p>

<h2 id="getting-prepared">Getting Prepared</h2>

<p>So I decided I&rsquo;d blow away the existing installation of 2012 on the box and
lay down ESXi. I then re-installed 2012 fresh as a VM on the ESXi host. I also
performed a P2V on the existing Windows 2003 SBS host. The P2V process is
outside the scope of this document, but was actually pretty easy. This will
allow me to take snapshots, and even clone the VM for some trial runs
(I don&rsquo;t have any lab hardware available for this).</p>

<p>fter getting the SBS server virtualized, I proceed to configure the new 2013 box as a member server with a static IP. I ensured its primary DNS server was set to the SBS server. I did not configure any roles or features at all yet.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m ready to proceed, I started by installing the support tools
from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15326">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15326</a>. With those
tools in place I ran through series of tests as outlined in <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/mweber/archive/2012/07/30/upgrading-an-active-directory-domain-from-windows-server-2003-or-windows-server-2003-r2-to-windows-server-2012.aspx">http://msmvps.com/blogs/mweber/archive/2012/07/30/upgrading-an-active-directory-domain-from-windows-server-2003-or-windows-server-2003-r2-to-windows-server-2012.aspx</a></p>

<p>{% highlight console %}<br />
Dcdiag /v /c /d /e /s:<sbs_server> &gt; c:\temp\dcdiag.log
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>The first error logged was:
{% highlight console %}
    * Checking Service: IsmServ
        IsmServ Service is stopped on [SERVER]
    &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; SERVER failed test Services
 {% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>Based <a href="http://blog.mpecsinc.ca/2008/07/sbs-dcdiag-produces-ismserv-error.html">http://blog.mpecsinc.ca/2008/07/sbs-dcdiag-produces-ismserv-error.html</a>,
it appears this is expected on SBS and safe to ignore, so doing just that.</p>

<p>The next error up was:</p>

<p>{% highlight console %}
      Starting test: systemlog
         * The System Event log test
         An Error Event occured.  EventID: 0xC0002719
            Time Generated: 11/28/2013   18:05:14
            (Event String could not be retrieved)
         &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. SERVER failed test systemlog
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>This seems to be related to a single event in my event log:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">    Event Type: Error
    Event Source:   DCOM
    Event Category: None
    Event ID:   10009
    Date:       11/28/2013
    Time:       6:05:14 PM
    User:       N/A
    Computer:   SERVER
    Description:
    DCOM was unable to communicate with the computer sbs.ip.add.ress using any of the configured protocols.

    For more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see any other occurrences of this error. I&rsquo;m assuming I could clear the
event logs to not see, but I&rsquo;d rather keep the event log history around, so I&rsquo;m
going to ignore this for now.</p>

<p>All the other tests passed, so I moved onto <code>Repadmin</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">Repadmin /showrepl sbs_host /verbose /all /intersite &gt;c:\repl.log
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing jumped out at me in this output. Next up <code>dnslint</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-console">  Dnslint /v /ad /s &quot;DCipaddress&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This one caught something interesting:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">Notes:
One or more DNS servers is not authoritative for the domain
</code></pre>

<p>After reviewing the output I found that at some point in time someone had
created a local host file entry for localhost that was the IP of the server.
Traditionally I believe localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1, rather than the actual
box IP, so I simply commented out the file entry. After that <code>dnslint</code> came
back clean.</p>

<p>I skipped the <code>adreplstatus</code> checks since this is a single node, and the tool
wanted me to install .net framework 4.0, which seemed heavy handed for a test
I didn&rsquo;t care about.</p>

<p>Next up I confirmed that both the <code>_msdcs.domain.local</code> and <code>domain.local</code> zones
were set to the <code>Active Directory-Integrated</code> type.</p>

<p>Next, I confirmed what level AD was currently at:</p>

<pre><code class="language-batch">Dsquery * cn=schema,cn=configuration,dc=domain,dc=local -scope base -attr objectVersion
</code></pre>

<p>This returned a value of <code>30</code> for me, which based on the link above means I&rsquo;m
at the <code>Windows Server 2003</code> which lines up with the version of SBS on the host.</p>

<p>At this point I took a snapshot of the host as we are going to start making
changes soon.</p>

<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>

<h3 id="add-2012-server-as-new-domain-controller">Add 2012 Server As New Domain Controller</h3>

<p>In my case the SBS server was at the <code>Windows 2000</code> level for <strong>both</strong> the
Domain Functional Level, as well as the Forest Functional Level.
Using <code>Active Directory Domains and Trusts</code> I increased both of these to the
<code>Windows 2003</code> level. This was done on the SBS 2003 node. Since its a single
SBS box, I figure replication time is essentially 0 so after trolling the Event
Logs for a few minutes to ensure nothing weird popped up, I proceeded.</p>

<p>I then stepped through the process of promoting the 2012 as a domain controller
which is well illustrated at  <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2013/05/05/step-by-step-adding-a-windows-server-2012-domain-controller-to-an-existing-windows-2003-network.aspx">http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2013/05/05/step-by-step-adding-a-windows-server-2012-domain-controller-to-an-existing-windows-2003-network.aspx</a></p>

<p>After the restart I noticed a few things that seemed off at first. The first
one was that I didn&rsquo;t have a netlogon share on the new 2012 DC. Additionally
there were some errors in the event log. I found that the
<code>File Replication Service</code> was stopped. It was set to automatic, so I started
it. After starting that service, I now had the netlogon share as well.</p>

<h3 id="update-dns-clients">Update DNS Clients</h3>

<p>At this point I updated the DNS settings on thew new 2012 server to reference
itself first.</p>

<p>Once that was completed, I then update my DHCP configuration on the SBS 2003
box (I&rsquo;ll move DHCP later), I updated the options to pass the new box as the
primary DNS server.</p>

<h3 id="transferring-fsmo-roles">Transferring FSMO Roles</h3>

<p>I then followed <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2013/05/27/step-by-step-active-directory-migration-from-windows-server-2003-to-windows-server-2012.aspx">http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2013/05/27/step-by-step-active-directory-migration-from-windows-server-2003-to-windows-server-2012.aspx</a>
to transfer all the FSMO and related roles over to the new server.</p>

<h3 id="update-time-configurations">Update Time Configurations</h3>

<p>As touched on toward the end of the <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/mweber/archive/2012/07/30/upgrading-an-active-directory-domain-from-windows-server-2003-or-windows-server-2003-r2-to-windows-server-2012.aspx">http://msmvps.com/blogs/mweber/archive/2012/07/30/upgrading-an-active-directory-domain-from-windows-server-2003-or-windows-server-2003-r2-to-windows-server-2012.aspx</a> I updated time settings as follows</p>

<p>2012 Server:</p>

<pre><code class="language-batch">w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:time.windows.com /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:yes /update
</code></pre>

<p>SBS 2003 Server:</p>

<pre><code class="language-batch">w32tm /config /syncfromflags:domhier /reliable:no /update
</code></pre>

<p>At this point I&rsquo;m going to let things bake for a bit. I&rsquo;ve got all the &laquo;AD Stuff&raquo;
moved over. At this point I&rsquo;m left with all the file shares and applications
(IE Virus Console) that are configured to point at this host.  As I get to
moving some of these items I&rsquo;ll add new parts.</p>

<p>I recently got the opportunity to play with a new Dell T420, and I decided I
would run ESXi 5 on it.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>My day job does not really allow me much hands on access to hardware any more
so its been a while since I&rsquo;ve gotten to build a new server, but I recently got
the chance to work on this as a side project. The server came
pre-installed with Windows 2012 Standard. I have a need to run a couple of VM&rsquo;s and I
decided I wanted to run ESXi on the host, and run the 2013 standard box as
a VM. For anyone that is curious, I didn&rsquo;t pick ESXi because its &laquo;better&raquo; than
Hyper-V (I have no clue how they stack up anymore). I simply chose it because
its been a couple of years since I&rsquo;ve built an ESX host and I wanted to see
how things have evolved.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was use the VMWare converter utility to P2V the existing
installation out to a VMWare workstation format. I didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> need to do
this since the OS was not customized yet, and I could reinstall, but this
was a chance to play with the converter, and see if if I could PBV the existing
installation and have it running on the newly rebuilt box. It worked well,
and maybe I&rsquo;ll write about that experience some day, but for now its all
about getting the box built.</p>

<h2 id="installing-open-manage-server-administrator">Installing Open Manage Server Administrator</h2>

<p>So step one was to grab the installation bits from
<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails/Product/poweredge-r710?driverId=WHYNF&amp;fileId=3006491785">Open Manage Download</a>.
I went with version 7.3.0.2 as it was the most recent available. It downloaded
the file to my workstation, as opposed to directly on the ESX host.</p>

<p>Next I started following the ESXi specific instructions in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_software/esuprt_ent_sys_mgmt/esuprt_ent_sys_mgmt_opnmng_sw/dell-opnmang-sw-v7.3_User%27s%20Guide2_en-us.pdf">Open Manage User Guide</a>.
While I can appreciate the time it takes to work up instructions that cover such
a wide array of platforms, I found these instructions a bit lacking. They had
several typos (missing spaces in command line commands) as well as were unclear
on a couple things, so I&rsquo;ll spend a little more time to add some details here.</p>

<p>I chose to go with the &laquo;Using The vSphere CLI&raquo; portion of the instructions, as
it seemed to be the most straight forward for folks without existing ESX
infrastructures in place. So with that, I had to download and install the
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vcli/">vSphere CLI</a>. This was pretty quick and painless. I didn&rsquo;t poke to much
at it, but it feels like its nothing more than a set of Perl scripts and it
adds a shortcut to a CMD session which I presume just tweaks the shell with
some environment variables</p>

<p>Now I copied the file over the suggested directory per the docs (I had to enable
 and start SSH access using the vSphere Client before this would work).</p>

<pre><code class="language-batch">   pscp OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-7.3.0-588_A00.VIB-ESX51i.zip root@192.168.1.1:/var/log/vmware/
   Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
   Password:
   OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-7.3. | 6490 kB | 1622.6 kB/s | ETA: 00:00:00 | 100%
</code></pre>

<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure how the docs assume you to unzip this, but I did it over an SSH
session, and the part that I messed up on first was that I unzipped the file
directly in <code>/var/log/vmware/</code>, when in reality all you have to do is run the
install command against the ZIP directly. There is no need to actually unzip it.</p>

<p>I later learned about the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vima/">vSphere Management Assistant</a>,
which I think is geared toward keeping SSH out of the mix. for now I ran the
command using the CLI</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">   esxcli --server 192.168.1.1 software vib install -d /var/log/vmware/OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-7.3.0-588_A00.VIB-ESX51i.zip

   Installation Result
      Message: The update completed successfully, but the system needs to be rebooted for the changes to be effective.
      Reboot Required: true
      VIBs Installed: Dell_bootbank_OpenManage_7.3.0.2-0000
      VIBs Removed:
      VIBs Skipped:
</code></pre>

<p>And then comes a reboot. Following the reboot I expected I would be able
to hit the OMSA HTTPS interface at <a href="https://192.168.1.1:1311">https://192.168.1.1:1311</a>, however that didn&rsquo;t
work, and it turns out is more more involved, and covered in the &laquo;Accessing Server Administrator on VMware ESXi&raquo;
section. Essentially it suggests that you have to a <strong>completely separate</strong>,
server running the web server. In my case, this is the only box on the network
so this seems like a crappy solution, but I suppose the logic is possibly to
keep the number of system daemons to an absolute minimum. In any event, I was
a bit disappointed to lose the web UI I&rsquo;ve grown to know.</p>

<h2 id="vsphere-management-assistant">vSphere Management Assistant</h2>

<p>At this point, I was a bit annoyed that I needed another system.
While trolling for ways to potentially hack the Web server in directly, I came
across a YouTube video on the subject at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hywERi8bc1c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hywERi8bc1c</a>.
While watching this at about 1:31 they jump to a screen I was not familiar with,
and after a little digging I discovered the
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vima/">vSphere Management Assistant</a>,
so I proceeded to download and <em>install</em> the virtual appliance as it seems it
will come in handy in the future as well.</p>

<p>So I downloaded the appliance, unzipped the file and and then followed the
instructions at <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp#com.vmware.vma.doc/vima_get_start.4.5.html">http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp#com.vmware.vma.doc/vima_get_start.4.5.html</a>.
This all went really smooth.</p>

<h2 id="installing-dell-omsa-into-the-vsphere-management-assistant">Installing Dell OMSA into the vSphere Management Assistant</h2>

<p>So I figured what the heck, at this point I have a VM already, lets install
the OMSA web interface here since I couldn&rsquo;t do it earlier. So I downloaded
the file from the dell website (they make it harder than is should be to get a
direct download link that I could wget from inside the VM so instead I
downloaded it on my workstation and uploaded it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-batch">pscp OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-LX-7.3.0-350_A00.SLES11.x86_64.tar.gz vi-admin@192.168.1.2:/tmp
</code></pre>

<p>Then via an SSH into the VMA appliance:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">   cd /tmp
   tar -zxvf OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-LX-7.3.0-350_A00.SLES11.x86_64.tar.gz
   sudo ./setup.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Accept the license agreement, and hit option 1 to install the Server Administrator Web Server Interface.
Followed by pressing &laquo;i&raquo;</p>

<p>And about 2 minutes later, we have our good old friend, the Open Manager web
interface available at https//vmaappliance_ip:1311, and I was able to use
it to connect to my ESXi host. A bit of a round about where to get there, but
something is better than nothing..</p>
