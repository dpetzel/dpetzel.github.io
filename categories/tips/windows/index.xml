      <description>If your using Github for Windows, there is a good chance you might be using the Powershell Git Shell. If your like me you may want to customize how that prompt looks. Turns out this is not nearly as trivial as it would initially seem.
If your not familiar with PoshGit, you can read a little more about it on their github page. In a nutshell, this integration enhances your current Powershell prompt to provide you with git related information right in your prompt.</description>

      <description>Nothing to exciting here, but its the 3rd or 4th time in recent history I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go looking for this, so I figured I would write it down finally.
There are times when a domain attached PC has RDP disabled for some reason. The following snippet, which I adapted from http://oreilly.com/windows/archive/server-hacks-remote-desktop.html makes it a little quicker. Run this from a cmd prompt as a user with admin rights on the remote host.</description>

      <description>A while back a co-worker told me about Chocolately. I had taken a quick look and it seemed interesting, but I kind of forgot about it after that.
Well today, I was setting up a new machine and I had a handful of things I wanted to install. I was thinking to myself what a bummer it was going to be to have fire up Google and search for each of the package’s download sites.</description>
