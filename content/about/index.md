I'm a technology enthusiast, husband, dad, and
[Geocacher](<http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=2b261b0d-15e3-4c16-902f-a51932dd9ff5)
I've worked in technology for most of my working years. Even before that I had
an interest in computers dating all the way back to my very first PC, a
[Tandy 1000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000).

I grew up (professionally) on the enterprise IT side of things, but later on
moved into the web space (where I am today). I find the pace at which things
move on the Internet interesting and exciting. There is never any shortage of
new things to learn.

I started this site as a place to start collecting notes and thoughts on various
things I was learning about and/working on. I've found over the years that
you'll spend a lot of time researching and learning how to do something and
then about 6 months after you put it down you need it for real.
At that point, you forget all the nuances of the thing you were doing. I generally
try to keep some notes about these sorts of things, but I've never stored them
in a way that made them easy to find again later. So I decided this would
be that place.

While I generally don't have as much time as I would like to contribute to open
source projects, here are a few I do my best to maintain when I can find the
time:
