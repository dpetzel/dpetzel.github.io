      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my recent tasks was to automate the creation of multi-region Cassandra
clusters. I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty green with Cassandra but have been having some recent
success with creating multi-dc (replication group) clusters inside of a single
AWS region. The story that follows summarizes what was a painful few days
of debugging&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on building a highly available installation of Datastax Opscenter in
an automated fashion on AWS. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to abandon my pursuit of installing Opscenter with automatic
fail over and will propose an alternate solution which I believe still achieves high availability as well as
much better self-healing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend I decided it was time to replace the stock firmware on my WRT1200AC v2.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had the unit for a while now and it&amp;rsquo;s been working well but I had a little time
on my hands so I opted to give it a go.
The process itself was pretty easy, but finding the right information was not. Hopefully this saves someone else some time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

At only $40.00 I didn&amp;rsquo;t have very high expectations but I was pleasantly

      <description>This past week I was turned on to a tiny, but game changing (for me) gem named kitchen-sync.
I tend to use test-kitchen in a wide variety of configurations. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m using it to drive Vagrant, most of the time, I&amp;rsquo;m using it drive Docker, but there are times when I need it to drive remove instances such as EC2. One of my biggest pain points in this last configuration is the time it takes to copy of the cookbooks to the remote machine.</description>

      <title>Jekyll with fenced code blocks</title>

      <description>While hacking up some markdown files to use under Jekyll I hit a weird issue where code blocks written with triple ticks (aka fenced code blocks) wouldn&amp;rsquo;t render correctly.
When writing markdown, I like to express code blocks using the fenced-code-blocks syntax. I&amp;rsquo;m just getting up to speed with using Jekyll and after reading their documentation I found I could use their highlight liquid tag, but I just didn&amp;rsquo;t care for the look and feel of that.</description>

      <title>Modifying your PoshGit Prompt</title>

      <description>If your using Github for Windows, there is a good chance you might be using the Powershell Git Shell. If your like me you may want to customize how that prompt looks. Turns out this is not nearly as trivial as it would initially seem.
If your not familiar with PoshGit, you can read a little more about it on their github page. In a nutshell, this integration enhances your current Powershell prompt to provide you with git related information right in your prompt.</description>

      <description>Nothing to exciting here, but its the 3rd or 4th time in recent history I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go looking for this, so I figured I would write it down finally.
There are times when a domain attached PC has RDP disabled for some reason. The following snippet, which I adapted from http://oreilly.com/windows/archive/server-hacks-remote-desktop.html makes it a little quicker. Run this from a cmd prompt as a user with admin rights on the remote host.</description>

      <description>A while back a co-worker told me about Chocolately. I had taken a quick look and it seemed interesting, but I kind of forgot about it after that.
Well today, I was setting up a new machine and I had a handful of things I wanted to install. I was thinking to myself what a bummer it was going to be to have fire up Google and search for each of the package’s download sites.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been tasked with migrating a Windows 2003 Small Business Server to Windows 2013 Standard.
Without getting into too much of the back story, the client purchased Windows 2003 SBS many moons ago, however they never leveraged anything except Active Directory and File Sharing. They use their hosting provider&amp;rsquo;s web mail, and don&amp;rsquo;t have an appetite to change that.
Here are we many moons later and they are ready to upgrade.</description>

      <description>I recently got the opportunity to play with a new Dell T420, and I decided I would run ESXi 5 on it.
Background My day job does not really allow me much hands on access to hardware any more so its been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to build a new server, but I recently got the chance to work on this as a side project. The server came pre-installed with Windows 2012 Standard.</description>

      <description>I finally got around to picking up a Chromecast. I had read some reviews so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any high expectations, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge to tinker with it given its price point. Boy was I disappointed&amp;hellip;.
The instructions it came with made it look like it was going to be the easiest thing I ever hooked up. The physical hookup was simple enough, but then it came time to get it hooked up to my wireless.</description>

      <description>Recently I kicked off an effort to perform a long over due upgrade of the version of Django I am using on a project. Without getting into all the gory details of why, I need to upgrade from Django 1.2 to 1.5. Technically I don&amp;rsquo;t really have to go to 1.5, but I figure since I&amp;rsquo;m going to be messing with it anyway I should probably just get current. This post will journal my adventure down this road for better or worse.</description>

      <description>So today I was trying to clean up some of my Sphinx build warnings when rendering this site. I got everything fixed so I had no errors or warnings except for this little guy right here (truncated for easier reading):
~/dpetzel.info.tinkerer/2011/12/16/developing_a_command_parser_based_zenpack.rst:328: WARNING: nonlocal image URI found: https://external.domain/image.png  I know I&amp;rsquo;m linking to an external image. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to store my binary images in my Github repo .
I search google for a bit and couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything.</description>

      <description>For anyone that might have been following along I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out different solutions for static site generation of this site. I&amp;rsquo;d been running Pelican for a bit, but I was getting annoyed a bit with the limited directives. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to Sphinx at work for some project documentation and I wanted to see if I could leverage some of that. A little googling later and I found Tinkerer which is based on Sphinx but adds some workflow around the process to make blogging with Sphinx easier.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing to eye opening here but I wanted to collect some thoughts and insights
I had this week. While I&amp;rsquo;m more of an operations guy, a while back I hacked
up a &lt;code&gt;Django&lt;/code&gt; based web application which uses &lt;code&gt;Celery&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/code&gt;. I have
recent set out to do some performance analysis on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have started to become proficient with &lt;code&gt;Chef&lt;/code&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve also gotten used to
using the &lt;code&gt;minitest-chef-handler&lt;/code&gt; for writing integration tests for my
cookbooks. This quick post is to capture an approach I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to like for
doing HTTP tests of slow starting web applications. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that many
services will return from an &lt;code&gt;/sbin/service mysapp start&lt;/code&gt; well before
the application has fully started and is accepting HTTP connections.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve gone live with a static site using &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.getpelican.com&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
Originally I had kicked off my attempts at a static site using Mynt, which I
detailed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dpetzel.info/post/live_with_mynt/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There really wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything
wrong with Mynt, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right to me after having trying to use it.

so far as reading some of the documentation, however I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually
tried using it. So today, I decided to change that.

      <title>Publishing A Zenoss ZenPack to PyPi Using Travis-CI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: It was pointed out to me that while ZenPacks are technically eggs,
it is not always safe to promote them as a standard Python module, which is
why you don&amp;rsquo;t see more ZenPacks on PyPi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So read on if you are curious about how it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; work, but please don&amp;rsquo;t
make this part of your standard ZenPack release process.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do some testing on a Zenoss BIG-IP ZenPack I wrote today, and
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the access to a test box that I had when I initially wrote it.
So I decided I&amp;rsquo;d give the BIG-IP LTM VE a whirl.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The issue I was having is that the Cloud Zoom enhanced image was being
displayed in front of my drop down menu as well as my modal dialog box. At
first I had only noticed the issue on the drop menu, and was having a hard time
figuring out what was going on, and thought perhaps I had done something wrong
on the superfish menu. Once I noticed it was also affecting my modal dialog,
I became suspicious of cloud zoom.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick chronicle of my journey to install Apache Traffic Servers on
Centos 5.7. In the end it ended up being a lot easier than I was expecting,
given how sporadic and incomplete the documentation on their site is.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are here, you probably already know what Varnish is, but in case you don’t….&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.varnish-cache.org/&#34;&gt;https://www.varnish-cache.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varnish Cache is an open source, state of the art web application accelerator.
  It is installed in front of your webserver where it will cache the content,
  resulting in a huge performance boost.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This took me far longer than it should have, and while I&amp;rsquo;d like to blame
shotty documentation and sparse examples it was probably my own stupidity
causing the issue. Whatever the case maybe I wanted to jot down my results
as I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll need to do this again.

      <title>Template Generated Array in Velocity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was trying to do something in a velocity template that I found to be a little
harder than I would have guessed. I was trying to manually generate an array from within my template.
I had a single template that I needed to wrap some super crude IP checking around. I have a couple of
ip addresses which are allowed to see the template code, but everyone else should get the boot.

      <description>Inspiration I still consider myself a relative newb with Zenoss as well as Python development. A while back I set out to write a custom ZenPack for use with F5 LTMs_. I never would have been able to figure this out without the assistance of a great guide written by Jane Curry. Her outstanding document can be found on the Zenoss community site: http://community.zenoss.org/docs/DOC-10268
I recently had a need for a ZenPack to interact with a couple of Varnish 3.</description>
