      <description>A while back a co-worker told me about Chocolately. I had taken a quick look and it seemed interesting, but I kind of forgot about it after that.
Well today, I was setting up a new machine and I had a handful of things I wanted to install. I was thinking to myself what a bummer it was going to be to have fire up Google and search for each of the package’s download sites.</description>
