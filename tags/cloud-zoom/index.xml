      <description>&lt;p&gt;The issue I was having is that the Cloud Zoom enhanced image was being
displayed in front of my drop down menu as well as my modal dialog box. At
first I had only noticed the issue on the drop menu, and was having a hard time
figuring out what was going on, and thought perhaps I had done something wrong
on the superfish menu. Once I noticed it was also affecting my modal dialog,
I became suspicious of cloud zoom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a page that is using a few different jQuery dependent features/functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using the superfish drop down menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also using the jQuery UI Dialog for a modal dialog box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, I&amp;rsquo;m using Cloud Zoom for some image excitement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through and tried a few different things, and finally just disabled
cloud zoom. At that point my drop down menu was now correctly displayed over
top of the image. I spent some time looking through the cloud-zoom site with no
luck. I spent quite a bit of time googling with no luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned my attention to the jQuery UI documentation for anything that might be
a clue. I was reading through the various options and came upon the zIndex
option. I had no idea what zIndex was (I am no jQuery expert). Long story short,
I finally got to this article: &lt;a href=&#34;http://zenverse.net/how-to-fix-superfish-dropdown-menu-that-appear-under-floating-divs-in-ie6/&#34;&gt;http://zenverse.net/how-to-fix-superfish-dropdown-menu-that-appear-under-floating-divs-in-ie6/&lt;/a&gt;
So I randomly picked a stupid high zIndex (100,000), and sure enough it worked!
So the question of the day is WHY? and what is the value of zIndex I need to
use? Well on a hunch I started digging through the cloud zoom javascript and
found line 350::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;  $(this).wrap(&#39;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;wrap&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;top:0px;z-index:9999;position:relative;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#39;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Cloud Zoom is using 9999. Any other components that has a z-index lower
than that will be displayed behind my images. So of course, I put this to the
test. I set my z-index to 10,000 on my menu and 10,001 on my modal dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick refresh and everything is working perfect!. zIndex&amp;hellip; who knew&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are wondering, yes I did test an iteration with the index of the
menu and modal dialog set to be lower than 9999 and as expected they were
hidden by the cloud zoom image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
