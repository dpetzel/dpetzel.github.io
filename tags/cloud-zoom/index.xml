      <description>&lt;p&gt;The issue I was having is that the Cloud Zoom enhanced image was being
displayed in front of my drop down menu as well as my modal dialog box. At
first I had only noticed the issue on the drop menu, and was having a hard time
figuring out what was going on, and thought perhaps I had done something wrong
on the superfish menu. Once I noticed it was also affecting my modal dialog,
I became suspicious of cloud zoom.
