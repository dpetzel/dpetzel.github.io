      <description>So today I was trying to clean up some of my Sphinx build warnings when rendering this site. I got everything fixed so I had no errors or warnings except for this little guy right here (truncated for easier reading):
~/dpetzel.info.tinkerer/2011/12/16/developing_a_command_parser_based_zenpack.rst:328: WARNING: nonlocal image URI found: https://external.domain/image.png  I know I&amp;rsquo;m linking to an external image. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to store my binary images in my Github repo .
I search google for a bit and couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything.</description>

      <description>For anyone that might have been following along I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out different solutions for static site generation of this site. I&amp;rsquo;d been running Pelican for a bit, but I was getting annoyed a bit with the limited directives. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to Sphinx at work for some project documentation and I wanted to see if I could leverage some of that. A little googling later and I found Tinkerer which is based on Sphinx but adds some workflow around the process to make blogging with Sphinx easier.</description>
