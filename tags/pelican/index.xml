      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve gone live with a static site using &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.getpelican.com&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
Originally I had kicked off my attempts at a static site using Mynt, which I
detailed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dpetzel.info/post/live_with_mynt/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There really wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything
wrong with Mynt, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right to me after having trying to use it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I decided to make the switch was Pelicans themes. I don&amp;rsquo;t
have a single artistic or stylish cell in my body, so I heavily rely on themes
by people who are good at making things look good. I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t find
many themes at all for Mynt, while Pelican has a pretty nice collection in their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes&#34;&gt;Pelican Themes Repo&lt;/a&gt;, which is
where I found this one (attributed in the footer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing was the directory layout just seems more &amp;laquo;me&amp;raquo;. I know that sounds
dumb, but I&amp;rsquo;m a believer in picking tools that fit your style, assuming the
technical merits are all the same. This was most certainly a case of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much else to report, just wanted to get the traditional &amp;laquo;hello world&amp;raquo; post
out there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
