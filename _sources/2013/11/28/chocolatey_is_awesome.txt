A while back a co-worker, told me about Chocolately. I had taken a quick look and it seemed interesting, but I kind of forgot about after that.
Well today, I was setting up a new machine, and I had a handful of things I wanted to install, and was thinking to myself what a bummer it was going to be to have fire up Google and search for each of the packages download sites. Then I recalled Chocolately. In under 10 minutes flat, I had read the quick start, installed Chocolately, and installed  a handful of packages on the box. It was awesome and is something Windows has been sorely missing for a very long time. So if you haven't already go check it out at http://chocolatey.org/. Now I have to fight the urge to start packing up my own stuff, and focus on the task at hand. I'll have to revisit the packaging process at a later date :).
