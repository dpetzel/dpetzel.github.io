About Me
========
I'm a technology enthusiast, husband, dad, and 
`Geocacher <http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=2b261b0d-15e3-4c16-902f-a51932dd9ff5>`_.
I've worked in technology for most of my working years. Even before that I had
an interest in computers dating all the way back to my very first PC, a 
`Tandy 1000 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000>`_.

I grew up (professionally) on the enterprise IT side of things, but later on
moved into the web space (where I am today). I find the pace at which things
move on the Internet interesting and exciting. There is never any shortage of
new things to learn about it.

I started this site as a place to start collecting notes and thoughts on various
things I was learning about and/working on. I've found over the years that 
you'll spend a lot of time researching and learning how to do something and 
then about 6 months after you put it down you need it for real. 
At that point, you forget all the  nuances of the thing were doing. I generally
try to keep some notes about these sorts of things, but I've never stored them
in a way that made them easy to find again later. So I decided this would
be that place. 

While I generally don't have as much time as I would like to contribute to open
source projects here are a few I do my best to maintain when I can find the 
time:

* Zenoss ZenPack: `F5 BIG-IP <http://wiki.zenoss.org/ZenPack:F5_BIG-IP_(Open_Source)>`_
* Zenoss ZenPack: `Rundeck <http://wiki.zenoss.org/ZenPack:Rundeck>`_
* Zenoss ZenPack: `Varnish3 <http://wiki.zenoss.org/ZenPack:Varnish_3>`_
* Chef Cookbook: `Zenoss <http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/zenoss>`_
* Chef Cookbook: `Zenoss Client <http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/zenoss_client>`_
