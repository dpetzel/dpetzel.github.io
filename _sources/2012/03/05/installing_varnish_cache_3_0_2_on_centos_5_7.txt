If you are here, you probably already know what Varnish is, but in case you don’t….https://www.varnish-cache.org/

	Varnish Cache is an open source, state of the art web application accelerator. It is installed in front of your webserver where it will 
	cache the content, resulting in a huge performance boost.

Now that we’ve gotten that out of way, lets get to it. As is the case with most things I post, this is not intended to be an official “how-to” document, but rather a journal of my adventures in doing it. As should always be the case I’m starting with the supplied installation documentation located here: https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/installation/install.html#centos-redhat

Start with a vanilla minimal install of Centos 5.7. I did perform a ‘yum update’ & ‘reboot’ after the initial installation of the OS, before starting with installing Varnish.

Lets create a repo file and leverage Varnish’s existing repo. We also need libedit out of EPEL, so enabling that repo as well. I suppose I could have just grabbed the single RPM just as easily…

.. code-block:: bash
  
  cd /tmp
  wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
  rpm -i epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
  rpm --nosignature -i http://repo.varnish-cache.org/redhat/varnish-3.0/el5/noarch/varnish-release-3.0-1.noarch.rpm

Install Varnish and its various dependencies

.. code-block:: bash

  yum -y install varnish

Fire it up!

.. code-block:: bash

  service varnish start

Check that its alive (The 503 response code is expected right now)

.. code-block:: bash

  # curl -I http://localhost:6081
  HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable

That’s about it, doesn’t get much easier than that. Perhaps if I get more ambitious I’ll post some configuration tweaks and or cool tricks (if I learn any).
