      <title>Django 1.2 to 1.5 Upgrade</title>

      <description>Recently I kicked off an effort to perform a long over due upgrade of the version of Django I am using on a project. Without getting into all the gory details of why, I need to upgrade from Django 1.2 to 1.5. Technically I don&amp;rsquo;t really have to go to 1.5, but I figure since I&amp;rsquo;m going to be messing with it anyway I should probably just get current. This post will journal my adventure down this road for better or worse.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing to eye opening here but I wanted to collect some thoughts and insights
I had this week. While I&amp;rsquo;m more of an operations guy, a while back I hacked
up a &lt;code&gt;Django&lt;/code&gt; based web application which uses &lt;code&gt;Celery&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/code&gt;. I have
recent set out to do some performance analysis on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cloud Zoom Is Blocking My Modal Dialog Box</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The issue I was having is that the Cloud Zoom enhanced image was being
displayed in front of my drop down menu as well as my modal dialog box. At
first I had only noticed the issue on the drop menu, and was having a hard time
figuring out what was going on, and thought perhaps I had done something wrong
on the superfish menu. Once I noticed it was also affecting my modal dialog,
I became suspicious of cloud zoom.

      <title>Sending an SMTP email in Python 3</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/programming/sending_an_smtp_email_in_python_3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This took me far longer than it should have, and while I&amp;rsquo;d like to blame
shotty documentation and sparse examples it was probably my own stupidity
causing the issue. Whatever the case maybe I wanted to jot down my results
as I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll need to do this again.

      <title>Template Generated Array in Velocity</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/programming/template_generated_array_in_velocity/</link>

      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/programming/template_generated_array_in_velocity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was trying to do something in a velocity template that I found to be a little
harder than I would have guessed. I was trying to manually generate an array from within my template.
I had a single template that I needed to wrap some super crude IP checking around. I have a couple of
ip addresses which are allowed to see the template code, but everyone else should get the boot.
