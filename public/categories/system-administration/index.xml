      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been tasked with migrating a Windows 2003 Small Business Server to Windows 2013 Standard.
Without getting into too much of the back story, the client purchased Windows 2003 SBS many moons ago, however they never leveraged anything except Active Directory and File Sharing. They use their hosting provider&amp;rsquo;s web mail, and don&amp;rsquo;t have an appetite to change that.
Here are we many moons later and they are ready to upgrade.</description>

      <description>I recently got the opportunity to play with a new Dell T420, and I decided I would run ESXi 5 on it.
Background My day job does not really allow me much hands on access to hardware any more so its been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to build a new server, but I recently got the chance to work on this as a side project. The server came pre-installed with Windows 2012 Standard.</description>
