                This past week I was turned on to a tiny, but game changing (for me) gem named kitchen-sync. I tend to use test-kitchen in a wide variety of configurations. Sometimes I&rsquo;m using it to drive Vagrant, most of the time, I&rsquo;m using it drive Docker, but there are times when I need it to drive remove instances such as EC2. One of my biggest pain points in this last configuration is the time it takes to copy of the cookbooks to the remote machine.

                While hacking up some markdown files to use under Jekyll I hit a weird issue where code blocks written with triple ticks (aka fenced code blocks) wouldn&rsquo;t render correctly. When writing markdown, I like to express code blocks using the fenced-code-blocks syntax. I&rsquo;m just getting up to speed with using Jekyll and after reading their documentation I found I could use their highlight liquid tag, but I just didn&rsquo;t care for the look and feel of that.

                If your using Github for Windows, there is a good chance you might be using the Powershell Git Shell. If your like me you may want to customize how that prompt looks. Turns out this is not nearly as trivial as it would initially seem. If your not familiar with PoshGit, you can read a little more about it on their github page. In a nutshell, this integration enhances your current Powershell prompt to provide you with git related information right in your prompt.

                Nothing to exciting here, but its the 3rd or 4th time in recent history I&rsquo;ve had to go looking for this, so I figured I would write it down finally. There are times when a domain attached PC has RDP disabled for some reason. The following snippet, which I adapted from http://oreilly.com/windows/archive/server-hacks-remote-desktop.html makes it a little quicker. Run this from a cmd prompt as a user with admin rights on the remote host.

                A while back a co-worker told me about Chocolately. I had taken a quick look and it seemed interesting, but I kind of forgot about it after that. Well today, I was setting up a new machine and I had a handful of things I wanted to install. I was thinking to myself what a bummer it was going to be to have fire up Google and search for each of the packageâ€™s download sites.

                I&rsquo;ve recently been tasked with migrating a Windows 2003 Small Business Server to Windows 2013 Standard. Without getting into too much of the back story, the client purchased Windows 2003 SBS many moons ago, however they never leveraged anything except Active Directory and File Sharing. They use their hosting provider&rsquo;s web mail, and don&rsquo;t have an appetite to change that. Here are we many moons later and they are ready to upgrade.

                I recently got the opportunity to play with a new Dell T420, and I decided I would run ESXi 5 on it. Background My day job does not really allow me much hands on access to hardware any more so its been a while since I&rsquo;ve gotten to build a new server, but I recently got the chance to work on this as a side project. The server came pre-installed with Windows 2012 Standard.

                I finally got around to picking up a Chromecast. I had read some reviews so I didn&rsquo;t have any high expectations, but I couldn&rsquo;t resist the urge to tinker with it given its price point. Boy was I disappointed&hellip;. The instructions it came with made it look like it was going to be the easiest thing I ever hooked up. The physical hookup was simple enough, but then it came time to get it hooked up to my wireless.

                Recently I kicked off an effort to perform a long over due upgrade of the version of Django I am using on a project. Without getting into all the gory details of why, I need to upgrade from Django 1.2 to 1.5. Technically I don&rsquo;t really have to go to 1.5, but I figure since I&rsquo;m going to be messing with it anyway I should probably just get current. This post will journal my adventure down this road for better or worse.
