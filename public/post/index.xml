      <title>Speeding Up Test Kitchen</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week I was turned on to a tiny, but game changing (for me) gem named
&lt;code&gt;kitchen-sync&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to use test-kitchen in a wide variety of configurations. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m
using it to drive Vagrant, most of the time, I&amp;rsquo;m using it drive Docker, but
there are times when I need it to drive remove instances such as EC2. One
of my biggest pain points in this last configuration is the time it takes to
copy of the cookbooks to the remote machine. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got a cookbook that
has many dependencies (either directly or indirectly), this is a painful process.
It is especially aggravating because you&amp;rsquo;re probably only testing a change to
a single file, yet you have to wait for a billion other files that have not
changed to get copied again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/coderanger/kitchen-sync&#34;&gt;kitchen-sync&lt;/a&gt;.  Put out
by Noah Kantrowitz (a Chef super star), This little gem saves so much time when
your doing iterative development. The initial creation of the instance still
takes time as all the files have to be copied, however your second run will
have the file copy step take only a second or two. In my case I&amp;rsquo;ve got one
&lt;strong&gt;really nasty&lt;/strong&gt; cookbook that has so many dependencies it was taking 10-12
minutes &lt;strong&gt;each converge&lt;/strong&gt;. Using kitchen-sync my subsequent runs take only a
couple seconds to copy the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing any Chef development using test-kitchen and remote instances,
this is a &lt;strong&gt;must have&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jekyll with fenced code blocks</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/jekyll-with-fenced-code-blocks/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>dave@petzel.email (David Petzel)</author>
      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/jekyll-with-fenced-code-blocks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While hacking up some markdown files to use under Jekyll I hit a weird
issue where code blocks written with triple ticks (aka fenced code blocks)
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t render correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When writing markdown, I like to express code blocks using the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks&#34;&gt;fenced-code-blocks&lt;/a&gt;
syntax. I&amp;rsquo;m just getting up to speed with using Jekyll and after reading their
documentation I found I could use their &lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt; liquid tag, but I just didn&amp;rsquo;t
care for the look and feel of that. I&amp;rsquo;m just used to the fenced style, so I
wanted to use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I did something like this, it would work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ```
    my code snippet
    ```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doing this would result in the language getting included inside the code
block. Normally you&amp;rsquo;d see the language used as a guide for highlighting, and it
would not get actually output in the rendered content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ```console
    my code snippet
    ```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of digging and trial error I narrowed this down to the fact that
I was rendering with &lt;code&gt;kramdown&lt;/code&gt;. There were some mentions of the fenced code
blocks on &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/&#34;&gt;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/&lt;/a&gt; page, but it was not clear
to me what needed to happen. This is almost certainly a result of me being new
to Jekyll. I ended up determining that &lt;code&gt;Redcarpet&lt;/code&gt; is an alternate renderer to
&lt;code&gt;kramdown&lt;/code&gt;. So I added the following to my &lt;code&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;&gt;markdown: redcarpet
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making that change the fenced code blocks were now properly rendering
even with the language being specified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modifying your PoshGit Prompt</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/windows/modifying-your-poshgit-prompt/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>dave@petzel.email (David Petzel)</author>
      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/windows/modifying-your-poshgit-prompt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If your using &lt;a href=&#34;https://windows.github.com/&#34;&gt;Github for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, there is a
good chance you might be using the Powershell Git Shell. If your like me you
may want to customize how that prompt looks. Turns out this is not nearly as
trivial as it would initially seem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your not familiar with PoshGit, you can read a little more about it on their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/blob/master/readme.md&#34;&gt;github page&lt;/a&gt;. In
a nutshell, this integration enhances your current Powershell prompt to provide
you with git related information right in your prompt. For anyone that uses
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh&#34;&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/a&gt;, it provides similar
functionality to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powershell allows you to override the prompt by configuring a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ss64.com/ps/syntax-prompt.html&#34;&gt;prompt function&lt;/a&gt; inside your profile.  So let&amp;rsquo;s pause here..
this &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; simple enough, but the reality you&amp;rsquo;re profile is actually loaded
from one of a possible 4 files. Knowing exactly which one to edit is an adventure
on all on its own. That whole debacle is covered in detail at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.10.windowspowershell.aspx&#34;&gt;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.10.windowspowershell.aspx&lt;/a&gt;
so I&amp;rsquo;ll skip going into details there. We&amp;rsquo;ll leave it at knowing there is fairly
well documented (albeit cumbersome) methods of changing your Powershell prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter PoshGit. Since its nothing more than a wrapper around your existing
Powershell, it would seem logical that any shell customizations you may have
already applied would be used and PoshGit would extend upon that. Sad to say
that is not the case&amp;hellip; Now to be fair, the README for PoshGit does cover this,
but it takes a fair amount of connecting the dots to know that PoshGit is even
a thing. For me there was a series of research and trial and error that lead me
to learning what PoshGit was, the fact that it was part of Github for Windows,
and ultimately how to hack it to do what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll skip over the pain and agony I went through getting from A to B. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it
brief and say no amount of &lt;code&gt;profile.ps1&lt;/code&gt; hackery will work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead the key to success lies in &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\&amp;lt;you&amp;gt;\AppData\Local\GitHub\PoshGit_3874a02de8ce2b7d4908a8c0cb302294358b972c\profile.example.ps1&lt;/code&gt;
(I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that GUID looking number changes between installations).
Despite its name, this file is actually &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a sample, but is the actual
profile that is loaded by GitHub for Windows when using Powershell as your shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by creating a function named &lt;code&gt;global:prompt&lt;/code&gt; (I think just prompt might
also work). Inside that function make all your customizations, and then be sure
to include a call to &lt;code&gt;Write-VcsStatus&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;Write-VcsStatus&lt;/code&gt; is the key to
ensuring you continue to get all the git integration that PoshGit supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what my function looks like. In my case I was looking to not have
super long directory structures included in the prompt, and instead just
display the name of the directory I&amp;rsquo;m currently in. Credit for this goes to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://winterdom.com/2008/08/mypowershellprompt&#34;&gt;http://winterdom.com/2008/08/mypowershellprompt&lt;/a&gt; which I used to figure out
how to change the prompt, I adapted for my own tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34;&gt;function global:prompt {
  $cdelim = [ConsoleColor]::DarkCyan
  $chost = [ConsoleColor]::Green
  $cloc = [ConsoleColor]::Cyan

  write-host &amp;quot;$([char]0x0A7) &amp;quot; -n -f $cloc
  write-host &#39; {&#39; -n -f $cdelim
  write-host (split-path (pwd) -Leaf) -n -f $cloc
  write-host &#39;}&#39; -n -f $cdelim

  Write-VcsStatus

  $global:LASTEXITCODE = $realLASTEXITCODE
  return &amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your curious, this makes my shell look something like this (but with colors):&lt;/p&gt;

§  {dpetzel.github.io} [master +1 ~0 -0 !]&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the act of actually making the change wasn&amp;rsquo;t complicated
at all, however figuring out the &amp;laquo;what and where&amp;raquo; of what to change was a time
consuming process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing to exciting here, but its the 3rd or 4th time in recent history I&amp;rsquo;ve
had to go looking for this, so I figured I would write it down finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when a domain attached PC has RDP disabled for some reason.
The following snippet, which I adapted from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://oreilly.com/windows/archive/server-hacks-remote-desktop.html&#34;&gt;http://oreilly.com/windows/archive/server-hacks-remote-desktop.html&lt;/a&gt; makes it a
little quicker. Run this from a cmd prompt as a user with admin rights on the
remote host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight bat %}
set node=remote_pc_name
sc \%node% start RemoteRegistry
reg add &amp;laquo;\%node%\HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server&amp;raquo; /v fDenyTSConnections /d 0 /f

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back a co-worker told me about Chocolately. I had taken a quick
look and it seemed interesting, but I kind of forgot about it after
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well today, I was setting up a new machine and I had a handful of things
I wanted to install. I was thinking to myself what a bummer it was going
to be to have fire up Google and search for each of the package’s
download sites. Then I recalled Chocolately. In under 10 minutes flat I
had read the quick start, installed Chocolately, and installed a handful
of packages on the box. It was awesome and is something Windows has been
sorely missing for a very long time. So if you haven’t already, go check
it out at &lt;a href=&#34;http://chocolatey.org/&#34;&gt;http://chocolatey.org/&lt;/a&gt;. Now I have to fight the urge to
start packing up my own stuff, and focus on the task at hand. I’ll have
to revisit the packaging process at a later date :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Migrating from Windows 2003 SBS to Windows 2012 Standard Part I</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/windows/migrating-from-windows-2003-sbs-to-windows-2012-standard-part-i/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/windows/migrating-from-windows-2003-sbs-to-windows-2012-standard-part-i/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been tasked with migrating a Windows 2003 Small Business Server
to Windows 2013 Standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without getting into too much of the back story, the client purchased Windows
2003 SBS many moons ago, however they never leveraged anything except Active
Directory and File Sharing. They use their hosting provider&amp;rsquo;s web mail, and
don&amp;rsquo;t have an appetite to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are we many moons later and they are ready to upgrade. They&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a
new, fairly beefy, box running Windows 2012 Standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some discussions around the path they would prefer to take we&amp;rsquo;ve decided
we don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to touch all of the PCs and move them to a new domain,
and we&amp;rsquo;d like the upgrade to be as seamless as possible. To that end the decision
was made to attempt a &lt;em&gt;migration&lt;/em&gt;. This document will hopefully capture my
journey down this path. Its been at least 5 years since I&amp;rsquo;ve touched a &amp;laquo;real&amp;raquo;
domain controller, so a decent amount of reading is order, but from what I have
gathered so far this is not a standard conversion path, but it appears there
are some options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-prepared&#34;&gt;Getting Prepared&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided I&amp;rsquo;d blow away the existing installation of 2012 on the box and
lay down ESXi. I then re-installed 2012 fresh as a VM on the ESXi host. I also
performed a P2V on the existing Windows 2003 SBS host. The P2V process is
outside the scope of this document, but was actually pretty easy. This will
allow me to take snapshots, and even clone the VM for some trial runs
(I don&amp;rsquo;t have any lab hardware available for this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fter getting the SBS server virtualized, I proceed to configure the new 2013 box as a member server with a static IP. I ensured its primary DNS server was set to the SBS server. I did not configure any roles or features at all yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;m ready to proceed, I started by installing the support tools
from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15326&#34;&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15326&lt;/a&gt;. With those
tools in place I ran through series of tests as outlined in &lt;a href=&#34;http://msmvps.com/blogs/mweber/archive/2012/07/30/upgrading-an-active-directory-domain-from-windows-server-2003-or-windows-server-2003-r2-to-windows-server-2012.aspx&#34;&gt;http://msmvps.com/blogs/mweber/archive/2012/07/30/upgrading-an-active-directory-domain-from-windows-server-2003-or-windows-server-2003-r2-to-windows-server-2012.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight console %}&lt;br /&gt;
Dcdiag /v /c /d /e /s:&lt;sbs_server&gt; &amp;gt; c:\temp\dcdiag.log
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first error logged was:
{% highlight console %}
    * Checking Service: IsmServ
        IsmServ Service is stopped on [SERVER]
    &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; SERVER failed test Services
 {% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mpecsinc.ca/2008/07/sbs-dcdiag-produces-ismserv-error.html&#34;&gt;http://blog.mpecsinc.ca/2008/07/sbs-dcdiag-produces-ismserv-error.html&lt;/a&gt;,
it appears this is expected on SBS and safe to ignore, so doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next error up was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% highlight console %}
      Starting test: systemlog
         * The System Event log test
         An Error Event occured.  EventID: 0xC0002719
            Time Generated: 11/28/2013   18:05:14
            (Event String could not be retrieved)
         &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;. SERVER failed test systemlog
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be related to a single event in my event log:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;    Event Type: Error
    Event Source:   DCOM
    Event Category: None
    Event ID:   10009
    Date:       11/28/2013
    Time:       6:05:14 PM
    User:       N/A
    Computer:   SERVER
    Description:
    DCOM was unable to communicate with the computer sbs.ip.add.ress using any of the configured protocols.

    For more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t see any other occurrences of this error. I&amp;rsquo;m assuming I could clear the
event logs to not see, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather keep the event log history around, so I&amp;rsquo;m
going to ignore this for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the other tests passed, so I moved onto &lt;code&gt;Repadmin&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;Repadmin /showrepl sbs_host /verbose /all /intersite &amp;gt;c:\repl.log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing jumped out at me in this output. Next up &lt;code&gt;dnslint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;  Dnslint /v /ad /s &amp;quot;DCipaddress&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one caught something interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;Notes:
One or more DNS servers is not authoritative for the domain
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the output I found that at some point in time someone had
created a local host file entry for localhost that was the IP of the server.
Traditionally I believe localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1, rather than the actual
box IP, so I simply commented out the file entry. After that &lt;code&gt;dnslint&lt;/code&gt; came
back clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped the &lt;code&gt;adreplstatus&lt;/code&gt; checks since this is a single node, and the tool
wanted me to install .net framework 4.0, which seemed heavy handed for a test
I didn&amp;rsquo;t care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up I confirmed that both the &lt;code&gt;_msdcs.domain.local&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;domain.local&lt;/code&gt; zones
were set to the &lt;code&gt;Active Directory-Integrated&lt;/code&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I confirmed what level AD was currently at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-batch&#34;&gt;Dsquery * cn=schema,cn=configuration,dc=domain,dc=local -scope base -attr objectVersion
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This returned a value of &lt;code&gt;30&lt;/code&gt; for me, which based on the link above means I&amp;rsquo;m
at the &lt;code&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/code&gt; which lines up with the version of SBS on the host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I took a snapshot of the host as we are going to start making
changes soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;upgrading&#34;&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-2012-server-as-new-domain-controller&#34;&gt;Add 2012 Server As New Domain Controller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case the SBS server was at the &lt;code&gt;Windows 2000&lt;/code&gt; level for &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; the
Domain Functional Level, as well as the Forest Functional Level.
Using &lt;code&gt;Active Directory Domains and Trusts&lt;/code&gt; I increased both of these to the
&lt;code&gt;Windows 2003&lt;/code&gt; level. This was done on the SBS 2003 node. Since its a single
SBS box, I figure replication time is essentially 0 so after trolling the Event
Logs for a few minutes to ensure nothing weird popped up, I proceeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then stepped through the process of promoting the 2012 as a domain controller
which is well illustrated at  &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2013/05/05/step-by-step-adding-a-windows-server-2012-domain-controller-to-an-existing-windows-2003-network.aspx&#34;&gt;http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2013/05/05/step-by-step-adding-a-windows-server-2012-domain-controller-to-an-existing-windows-2003-network.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the restart I noticed a few things that seemed off at first. The first
one was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a netlogon share on the new 2012 DC. Additionally
there were some errors in the event log. I found that the
&lt;code&gt;File Replication Service&lt;/code&gt; was stopped. It was set to automatic, so I started
it. After starting that service, I now had the netlogon share as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-dns-clients&#34;&gt;Update DNS Clients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I updated the DNS settings on thew new 2012 server to reference
itself first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that was completed, I then update my DHCP configuration on the SBS 2003
box (I&amp;rsquo;ll move DHCP later), I updated the options to pass the new box as the
primary DNS server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;transferring-fsmo-roles&#34;&gt;Transferring FSMO Roles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then followed &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2013/05/27/step-by-step-active-directory-migration-from-windows-server-2003-to-windows-server-2012.aspx&#34;&gt;http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2013/05/27/step-by-step-active-directory-migration-from-windows-server-2003-to-windows-server-2012.aspx&lt;/a&gt;
to transfer all the FSMO and related roles over to the new server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-time-configurations&#34;&gt;Update Time Configurations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As touched on toward the end of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://msmvps.com/blogs/mweber/archive/2012/07/30/upgrading-an-active-directory-domain-from-windows-server-2003-or-windows-server-2003-r2-to-windows-server-2012.aspx&#34;&gt;http://msmvps.com/blogs/mweber/archive/2012/07/30/upgrading-an-active-directory-domain-from-windows-server-2003-or-windows-server-2003-r2-to-windows-server-2012.aspx&lt;/a&gt; I updated time settings as follows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2012 Server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-batch&#34;&gt;w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:time.windows.com /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:yes /update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBS 2003 Server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-batch&#34;&gt;w32tm /config /syncfromflags:domhier /reliable:no /update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;rsquo;m going to let things bake for a bit. I&amp;rsquo;ve got all the &amp;laquo;AD Stuff&amp;raquo;
moved over. At this point I&amp;rsquo;m left with all the file shares and applications
(IE Virus Console) that are configured to point at this host.  As I get to
moving some of these items I&amp;rsquo;ll add new parts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Dell T420 with ESXi 5</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I recently got the opportunity to play with a new Dell T420, and I decided I
would run ESXi 5 on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day job does not really allow me much hands on access to hardware any more
so its been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to build a new server, but I recently got
the chance to work on this as a side project. The server came
pre-installed with Windows 2012 Standard. I have a need to run a couple of VM&amp;rsquo;s and I
decided I wanted to run ESXi on the host, and run the 2013 standard box as
a VM. For anyone that is curious, I didn&amp;rsquo;t pick ESXi because its &amp;laquo;better&amp;raquo; than
Hyper-V (I have no clue how they stack up anymore). I simply chose it because
its been a couple of years since I&amp;rsquo;ve built an ESX host and I wanted to see
how things have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was use the VMWare converter utility to P2V the existing
installation out to a VMWare workstation format. I didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to do
this since the OS was not customized yet, and I could reinstall, but this
was a chance to play with the converter, and see if if I could PBV the existing
installation and have it running on the newly rebuilt box. It worked well,
and maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write about that experience some day, but for now its all
about getting the box built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-open-manage-server-administrator&#34;&gt;Installing Open Manage Server Administrator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So step one was to grab the installation bits from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails/Product/poweredge-r710?driverId=WHYNF&amp;amp;fileId=3006491785&#34;&gt;Open Manage Download&lt;/a&gt;.
I went with version 7.3.0.2 as it was the most recent available. It downloaded
the file to my workstation, as opposed to directly on the ESX host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I started following the ESXi specific instructions in the
&lt;a href=&#34;ftp://ftp.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_software/esuprt_ent_sys_mgmt/esuprt_ent_sys_mgmt_opnmng_sw/dell-opnmang-sw-v7.3_User%27s%20Guide2_en-us.pdf&#34;&gt;Open Manage User Guide&lt;/a&gt;.
While I can appreciate the time it takes to work up instructions that cover such
a wide array of platforms, I found these instructions a bit lacking. They had
several typos (missing spaces in command line commands) as well as were unclear
on a couple things, so I&amp;rsquo;ll spend a little more time to add some details here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to go with the &amp;laquo;Using The vSphere CLI&amp;raquo; portion of the instructions, as
it seemed to be the most straight forward for folks without existing ESX
infrastructures in place. So with that, I had to download and install the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vcli/&#34;&gt;vSphere CLI&lt;/a&gt;. This was pretty quick and painless. I didn&amp;rsquo;t poke to much
at it, but it feels like its nothing more than a set of Perl scripts and it
adds a shortcut to a CMD session which I presume just tweaks the shell with
some environment variables&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I copied the file over the suggested directory per the docs (I had to enable
 and start SSH access using the vSphere Client before this would work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-batch&#34;&gt;   pscp OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-7.3.0-588_A00.VIB-ESX51i.zip root@192.168.1.1:/var/log/vmware/
   Using keyboard-interactive authentication.
   Password:
   OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-7.3. | 6490 kB | 1622.6 kB/s | ETA: 00:00:00 | 100%
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how the docs assume you to unzip this, but I did it over an SSH
session, and the part that I messed up on first was that I unzipped the file
directly in &lt;code&gt;/var/log/vmware/&lt;/code&gt;, when in reality all you have to do is run the
install command against the ZIP directly. There is no need to actually unzip it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I later learned about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vima/&#34;&gt;vSphere Management Assistant&lt;/a&gt;,
which I think is geared toward keeping SSH out of the mix. for now I ran the
command using the CLI&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;   esxcli --server 192.168.1.1 software vib install -d /var/log/vmware/OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-7.3.0-588_A00.VIB-ESX51i.zip

   Installation Result
      Message: The update completed successfully, but the system needs to be rebooted for the changes to be effective.
      Reboot Required: true
      VIBs Installed: Dell_bootbank_OpenManage_7.3.0.2-0000
      VIBs Removed:
      VIBs Skipped:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then comes a reboot. Following the reboot I expected I would be able
to hit the OMSA HTTPS interface at &lt;a href=&#34;https://192.168.1.1:1311&#34;&gt;https://192.168.1.1:1311&lt;/a&gt;, however that didn&amp;rsquo;t
work, and it turns out is more more involved, and covered in the &amp;laquo;Accessing Server Administrator on VMware ESXi&amp;raquo;
section. Essentially it suggests that you have to a &lt;strong&gt;completely separate&lt;/strong&gt;,
server running the web server. In my case, this is the only box on the network
so this seems like a crappy solution, but I suppose the logic is possibly to
keep the number of system daemons to an absolute minimum. In any event, I was
a bit disappointed to lose the web UI I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vsphere-management-assistant&#34;&gt;vSphere Management Assistant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I was a bit annoyed that I needed another system.
While trolling for ways to potentially hack the Web server in directly, I came
across a YouTube video on the subject at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hywERi8bc1c&#34;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hywERi8bc1c&lt;/a&gt;.
While watching this at about 1:31 they jump to a screen I was not familiar with,
and after a little digging I discovered the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vima/&#34;&gt;vSphere Management Assistant&lt;/a&gt;,
so I proceeded to download and &lt;em&gt;install&lt;/em&gt; the virtual appliance as it seems it
will come in handy in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I downloaded the appliance, unzipped the file and and then followed the
instructions at &lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp#com.vmware.vma.doc/vima_get_start.4.5.html&#34;&gt;http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp#com.vmware.vma.doc/vima_get_start.4.5.html&lt;/a&gt;.
This all went really smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-dell-omsa-into-the-vsphere-management-assistant&#34;&gt;Installing Dell OMSA into the vSphere Management Assistant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I figured what the heck, at this point I have a VM already, lets install
the OMSA web interface here since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it earlier. So I downloaded
the file from the dell website (they make it harder than is should be to get a
direct download link that I could wget from inside the VM so instead I
downloaded it on my workstation and uploaded it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-batch&#34;&gt;pscp OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-LX-7.3.0-350_A00.SLES11.x86_64.tar.gz vi-admin@192.168.1.2:/tmp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then via an SSH into the VMA appliance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;   cd /tmp
   tar -zxvf OM-SrvAdmin-Dell-Web-LX-7.3.0-350_A00.SLES11.x86_64.tar.gz
   sudo ./setup.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accept the license agreement, and hit option 1 to install the Server Administrator Web Server Interface.
Followed by pressing &amp;laquo;i&amp;raquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about 2 minutes later, we have our good old friend, the Open Manager web
interface available at https//vmaappliance_ip:1311, and I was able to use
it to connect to my ESXi host. A bit of a round about where to get there, but
something is better than nothing..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chromecast Woes</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/chromecast-woes/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>dave@petzel.email (David Petzel)</author>
      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/chromecast-woes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to picking up a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast&#34;&gt;Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;. I had read some reviews
so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any high expectations, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge to
tinker with it given its price point. Boy was I disappointed&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions it came with made it look like it was going to be the easiest thing
I ever hooked up. The physical hookup was simple enough, but then it came time
to get it hooked up to my wireless. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything fancy, just a Linksys
E3200 with &lt;code&gt;WPA2/WPA Mixed Mode&lt;/code&gt; security. I&amp;rsquo;ve hooked up a ton of devices
and never had any issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chromecast App was useless. It could see my Chromecast, but I
just kept getting a grey exclamation mark with a message saying it couldn&amp;rsquo;t
connect. I went back and forth with the online help and the only useful thing
I found was the link to the web based setup instructions located at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cast.google.com/chromecast/setup?np=manualsetup&#34;&gt;https://cast.google.com/chromecast/setup?np=manualsetup&lt;/a&gt;. With this I was able
able to get a little further. I got as far as it displaying a 4 letter code
for me to confirm. Once I did that, it failed to connect again. What!?!?!
You can &lt;strong&gt;obviously&lt;/strong&gt; connect, since you just synced up that 4 letter code!!!
A bunch of google searching and nothing useful. Finally for no good reason other than
a lucky guess, I changed the network type on my Laptop &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Chromecast wifi
network from Public to Home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I made that switch the Web based setup got a little bit further and it
prompted me for my wireless password. Entered and it failed to connect&amp;hellip;
For kicks I tried the application again, it was still useless, so back to the
web based setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up having to power off the Chromecast one more time and then running
through the setup wizard again. Finally I had it hooked up the wireless. While
I can appreciate the target audience probably needs the &amp;laquo;magic config&amp;raquo; I really
wish they would have just given me the &amp;laquo;I know what the eff I&amp;rsquo;m doing&amp;raquo; option
and just entered my wifi info directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had it connected, the native casting support in YouTube worked really well
I have a YouTube app native on my TV and the quality of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast&#34;&gt;Chromecast&lt;/a&gt; was
better than the native app. Sadly, the &amp;laquo;cast my Chrome tab&amp;raquo; option didn&amp;rsquo;t have
the same quality. I tried to play a recent episode of the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/&#34;&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/a&gt;,
but the quality was terrible and it kept freezing. It was not watchable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next test I did was to stream the Thursday Night Football game from nfl.com
This was a little better but still pretty choppy. I was able to reduce the
choppiness by dropping the quality down to 480p. Given that I cut the cord a
while back, the fact that I was able to watch a game that was not broadcast
on one of the national network channels was pretty cool. The game was watchable
(its playing as I write this), but its certainly not a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at the end of the day, the only thing I would consider a success was the YouTube
integration, but given I have the YouTube native app on my TV, I really don&amp;rsquo;t feel like
I gained anything. If your a techy/gadget person its worth the $35 as something fun
to play with, but as of right now I struggle to see it being a valuable addition
to my media consumption choices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Django 1.2 to 1.5 Upgrade</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/programming/django-12-to-15-upgrade/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Recently I kicked off an effort to perform a long over due upgrade of the
version of Django I am using on a project. Without getting into all the gory
details of why, I need to upgrade from Django 1.2 to 1.5. Technically I don&amp;rsquo;t
really have to go to 1.5, but I figure since I&amp;rsquo;m going to be messing with it
anyway I should probably just get current. This post will journal my adventure
down this road for better or worse. Just to satisfy curiosity, I did test
going from 1.2 to 1.5 directly and as expected things blew up horribly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I knew a ton of stuff had changed my plan attack was going to be to step
through each an upgrade to each major version between 1.2 and 1.5 rather than
attempting to jump straight there. I intend to run my tests with the &lt;code&gt;-Wall&lt;/code&gt;
flags so I can see all the deprecation warnings. Then I&amp;rsquo;ll tackle each
deprecation warning one at a time. There is likely a more efficient means of
doing this sort of thing, but its been so long since I&amp;rsquo;ve messed with this
project I&amp;rsquo;m going to need some time to get reacquainted anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;note&#34;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;
    To protect the innocent, any proprietary information include class names,
    file names, paths etc have been stripped from the code snippets.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-2-7-to-1-3-7&#34;&gt;1.2.7 to 1.3.7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wen&amp;rsquo;t really smooth for me. All my unit tests passed and I didn&amp;rsquo;t see
anything immediately broken. There were a few deprecation warnings that I needed
to address however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;    ./django/core/cache/__init__.py:83: PendingDeprecationWarning: settings.CACHE_* is deprecated; use settings.CACHES instead.
  PendingDeprecationWarning
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was pretty cut and dry as the 1.3 release notes had alerted me to this
one: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.3/#caching-changes&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.3/#caching-changes&lt;/a&gt;.
Simply changing the structure of that configuration item and all was well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;    /filename.py:14: DeprecationWarning: A Field class whose get_db_prep_value method hasn&#39;t been updated to take `connection` and `prepared` arguments.
  class MyModelClass(models.Field):
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little google foo later and I ended up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.djangopro.com/2011/03/deprecation-warning-with-get_db_prep_value-for-django-1-3/&#34;&gt;http://www.djangopro.com/2011/03/deprecation-warning-with-get_db_prep_value-for-django-1-3/&lt;/a&gt;. The advise was to update to a newer version of &lt;code&gt;django-picklefield&lt;/code&gt;. I reviewed the
dependencies I had defined in the my &lt;code&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; and I was using
&amp;lsquo;0.3.0&amp;rsquo;, which was newer than the &amp;lsquo;0.1.9&amp;rsquo; version recommended in the article,
and also appears to be the most current version available on pypi.python.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that dead end out of the way I then found &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/howto/custom-model-fields/#django.db.models.Field.get_db_prep_value&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/howto/custom-model-fields/#django.db.models.Field.get_db_prep_value&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I updated my &lt;code&gt;get_db_prep_value&lt;/code&gt; as follows.
Old:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;    def get_db_prep_value(self, value):
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;    def get_db_prep_value(self, value, connection, prepared=False):
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicked another test run. No more deprecation warning and tests are all passing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;    ./site-packages/Crypto/Util/randpool.py:40: RandomPool_DeprecationWarning: This application uses RandomPool, which is BROKEN in older releases.  See http://www.pycrypto.org/randpool-broken
  RandomPool_DeprecationWarning)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t really clear to me what I was supposed to do with this information,
so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d start simple and upgrade the version of pycrypto I&amp;rsquo;m using
from 2.3 to the latest available 2.6. This did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; help.. I really have no
clue what to do with this. Since its not coming out directly from a Django
module, I&amp;rsquo;m going to ignore it for now&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last up was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;    ./site-packages/django/test/simple.py:28: PendingDeprecationWarning: DjangoTestRunner is deprecated; it&#39;s functionality is indistinguishable from TextTestRunner
  PendingDeprecationWarning
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recalled there was something about this in the release notes so I reviewed
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.3/#djangotestrunner&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.3/#djangotestrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Near as
I can tell there is nothing I need to do here, and Django itself will handle
this cleanup in coming versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That concludes my 1.2.7 to 1.3.7 upgrade. I ended up keeping the updated version
of pycrypto just because, so all and all pretty easy so far and only about 2
hours burned on that step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-3-7-to-1-4-8&#34;&gt;1.3.7 to 1.4.8&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that section out of the way onto reading the 1.4 release notes to see
what gotchas I need to look out for. Based on the information in the release
notes here are the items I expect will require some attention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#django-conf-urls-defaults&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#django-conf-urls-defaults&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#django-contrib-admin&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#django-contrib-admin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#updated-default-project-layout-and-manage-py&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#updated-default-project-layout-and-manage-py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initial test run after upgrading, but before any changes, is showing that the
media stuff is indeed an issue, and I have several deprecation warnings related
to items addressed in the release notes. This isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be as easy as the
jump to 1.3.7 was&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m opting to tackle the broken things first, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll address the
deprecation warnings. So first up I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few customizations to my
settings.py file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added &lt;code&gt;django.contrib.staticfiles&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code&gt;INSTALLED_APPS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next I renamed my &lt;em&gt;media&lt;/em&gt; folder to &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t have user uploaded media
so this folder was for the purpose of static assets. And based on the
documentation media is intended to be used for user generated content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added &lt;code&gt;STATIC_URL = &#39;/static/&#39;&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated my templates to use the new static template tag as described in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a bit tedious, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t to bad. At this point all of my tests are still
passing, but I do have some &lt;code&gt;PendingDeprecationWarning&lt;/code&gt; warnings to deal with.
I suppose since the are Pending, I could procrastinate, but I&amp;rsquo;m in here now, so
biting the bullet and going after them..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;   ./site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py:455: PendingDeprecationWarning: The &#39;execute_manager&#39; function is deprecated, you likely need to update your &#39;manage.py&#39;; please see the Django 1.4 release notes (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/).
  PendingDeprecationWarning)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My imports worked out in such a way that I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to relocate the manage.py
file so all I did was swap out the contents as outlined in &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#updated-default-project-layout-and-manage-py&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#updated-default-project-layout-and-manage-py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, something busted though. After swapping out the contents of manage.py I
ended up with errors when trying to kick off my tests. I&amp;rsquo;m using the
django-jenkins app for my tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;   ./virtualenv/bin/python -Wall my_project/manage.py jenkins
   Unknown command: &#39;jenkins&#39;
   Type &#39;manage.py help&#39; for usage.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything immediately obvious jump out at me so I started by
updating from django-jenkins 0.11.1 to 0.14.0. No improvment (but I&amp;rsquo;m gonna
keep the newer version just the same).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon further inspection of &lt;code&gt;manage.py --help&lt;/code&gt; I noticed alot of the subcommands
were missing. In fact all I saw were the &lt;code&gt;[django]&lt;/code&gt; ones. So I moved my
&lt;code&gt;manage.py&lt;/code&gt; up one directory as discussed in the readme and all the subcommands
reappeared, including jenkins. So that was good, but the crappy things is
all my tests started failing&amp;hellip; So into the weeds of import cleanup I go..
This turned out to be much easier than I thought. All I needed was to change
ROOT_URLCONF = &amp;lsquo;urls&amp;rsquo;&lt;code&gt;to ROOT_URLCONF = &#39;my_project.urls&#39;&lt;/code&gt; and all of
tests started passing again. Added bonus, my PendingDeprecationWarning was gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;   ./site-packages/django/conf/__init__.py:75: DeprecationWarning: The ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX setting has been removed; use STATIC_URL instead.
  &amp;quot;use STATIC_URL instead.&amp;quot;, DeprecationWarning)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is easy enough, I had already added STATIC_URL when I fixed up things
earlier, so I just removed ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX from my settings.py&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears in the process of cleaning up some of the media stuff I also cleared
up some of the other DeprecationWarning messages. So at this point all my tests
are passing and no DeprecationWarning messages (aside from
&lt;code&gt;RandomPool_DeprecationWarning&lt;/code&gt; from earlier that I opted to ignore). Onto
the final leg! Total time in this leg minus distractions was about 2.5 hours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-4-8-to-1-5-4&#34;&gt;1.4.8 to 1.5.4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon an initial pass through the 1.5 release notes I was feeling pretty good
as I didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything in there I though would affect me. My tests said
otherwise (&lt;strong&gt;80% failure rate&lt;/strong&gt;). The common theme seemed to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;   from django.views.generic.simple import direct_to_template, redirect_to
   ImportError: No module named simple
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm&amp;hellip;. obviously I missed the memo somewhere&amp;hellip;Turns out I didn&amp;rsquo;t put two and
two together back in the my 1.3 steps as its called out there
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.3/#function-based-generic-views&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.3/#function-based-generic-views&lt;/a&gt;.
Not to sure why I didn&amp;rsquo;t get any deprecation warnings along the way but oh well
lets get that fixed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11428427/no-module-named-simple-error-in-django&#34;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11428427/no-module-named-simple-error-in-django&lt;/a&gt;
was the only remotely useful link I came up with in the first couple minutes
of searching. The common thread seems to stem from my urls.py file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems I have a sprinkling of &lt;code&gt;direct_to_template&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;redirect_to&lt;/code&gt; being
used. Its fairly clear that I need to switch from &lt;em&gt;Function-based generic views&lt;/em&gt;
to &lt;em&gt;Class-based generic views&lt;/em&gt;, and as luck would have it the documentation has
an awesome mapping to pull that off at &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/generic-views-migration/&#34;&gt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/generic-views-migration/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is what I did to my urls.py.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replaced &lt;code&gt;from django.views.generic.simple import direct_to_template, redirect_to&lt;/code&gt;
with &lt;code&gt;from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView, RedirectView&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replaced &lt;code&gt;redirect_to&lt;/code&gt; references with RedirectView as outlined in that
migration page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;direct_to_template&lt;/code&gt; references with TemplateView as outlined in
that migration page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I had something like this (some legacy stuff to handle when URLs changed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;   (r&#39;^base_prefix/(?P&amp;lt;new_url&amp;gt;.*)$&#39;, redirect_to, {&#39;url&#39;: &#39;/%(new_url)s&#39;}),
   changed to
   (r&#39;^base_prefix/(?P&amp;lt;new_url&amp;gt;.*)$&#39;, RedirectView.as_view(url={&#39;url&#39;: &#39;/%(new_url)s&#39;})),
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one seemed easy enough, however the next one is nastier.. Making it worse
was it was something I didn&amp;rsquo;t write so I had to figure out the previous
functionality first, before I could move forward. So I had a line that looked
like &lt;code&gt;(r&#39;^bar&#39;, direct_to_template, {&#39;template&#39;: &#39;foo/bar.html&#39;}, &#39;bar&#39;),&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a bit to figure out that the last &lt;em&gt;bar&lt;/em&gt; was actually just a
&lt;code&gt;named url pattern &amp;lt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/http/urls/#naming-url-patterns&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a simple switch of that call over to &lt;code&gt;(r&#39;^bar&#39;, TemplateView.as_view(template_name=&#39;foo/bar.html&#39;), &#39;bar&#39;),&lt;/code&gt;
and we&amp;rsquo;re moving along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is more generic view good times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;   from django.views.generic import list_detail
   ImportError: cannot import name list_detail
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case this actually turned out to be an unused import, so I simply
removed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I had to a bunch of conversions of my url template tags as outlined
in the release notes. So I had a lot of references like
{% raw %}&lt;code&gt;{% url myproject.myapp.views.someview arg1%}&lt;/code&gt;{% endraw %} and I had to change those to
{% raw %}&lt;code&gt;{% url &amp;quot;myproject.myapp.views.someview&amp;quot; arg1%}&lt;/code&gt;{% endraw %}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;rsquo;m back to 100% testing pass rate and a single (simple)
deprecation message to handle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;   ./site-packages/django/conf/__init__.py:147: PendingDeprecationWarning: The TEMPLATE_DIRS setting must be a tuple. Please fix your settings, as auto-correction is now deprecated.
     PendingDeprecationWarning)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish they were all this easy. I went from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;   TEMPLATE_DIRS = os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, &#39;templates&#39;)
   to
   TEMPLATE_DIRS = (os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, &#39;templates&#39;),)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the process wasn&amp;rsquo;t terrible, but it was certainly not a cake walk either.
By the time it was all said and done, it took me about 2 days (including
randomizations and interruptions). As usual the Django documentation was
invaluable in being to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app has been running for a few days now and so far no unexpected explosions,
however I should note I have been getting some random reports of CSRF errors
since the upgrade (1 or 2 reports a day). Overall most people are having no
issues, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten too deep into that investigation, but it is
certainly new behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sphinx With External Image Annoyance</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/sphinx-with-external-image-annoyance/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>dave@petzel.email (David Petzel)</author>
      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/sphinx-with-external-image-annoyance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So today I was trying to clean up some of my Sphinx build warnings when
rendering this site. I got everything fixed so I had no errors or
warnings except for this little guy right here (truncated for easier
reading):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/dpetzel.info.tinkerer/2011/12/16/developing_a_command_parser_based_zenpack.rst:328: WARNING: nonlocal image URI found: https://external.domain/image.png
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;rsquo;m linking to an external image. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to store my binary
images in my Github repo .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I search google for a bit and couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything. This was so
annoying!! I don&amp;rsquo;t want these warnings every build to numb me to real
warnings so I I wanted to suppress them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, since this is just Python lets get to work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;$ grep -Rn &amp;quot;nonlocal image URI found&amp;quot; ~/virtualenvs/tinkerer/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
/home/dave/virtualenvs/tinkerer/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sphinx/environment.py:779:                self.warn_node(&#39;nonlocal image URI found: %s&#39; % imguri, node)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I edited line 779 in the file from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;    if imguri.find(&#39;://&#39;) != -1:
        self.warn_node(&#39;nonlocal image URI found: %s&#39; % imguri, node)
        candidates[&#39;?&#39;] = imguri
        continue
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to end up with:
{% highlight python %}
    if imguri.find(&amp;rsquo;://&amp;lsquo;) != -1:
        # self.warn_node(&amp;lsquo;nonlocal image URI found: %s&amp;rsquo; % imguri, node)
        candidates[&amp;lsquo;?&amp;rsquo;] = imguri
        continue
{% endhighlight %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila! No more warning for external images. If anyone knows the
&lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt; way to suppress these warnings (Yes I&amp;rsquo;ve read all the reasons
why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t) please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Switched To Tinkerer</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/switched_to_tinkerer/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>dave@petzel.email (David Petzel)</author>
      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/switched_to_tinkerer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For anyone that might have been following along I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out different
solutions for static site generation of this site. I&amp;rsquo;d been running &lt;code&gt;Pelican&lt;/code&gt;
for a bit, but I was getting annoyed a bit with the limited directives. I&amp;rsquo;ve
gotten used to &lt;code&gt;Sphinx&lt;/code&gt; at work for some project documentation and I wanted
to see if I could leverage some of that. A little googling later and I found
&lt;code&gt;Tinkerer&lt;/code&gt; which is based on Sphinx but adds some workflow around the process
to make blogging with &lt;code&gt;Sphinx&lt;/code&gt; easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve made the switch and what you are reading now was generated with Tinkerer.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have very much content yet so I just manually moved everything over,
although from what I saw if you had a lot of content it would be pretty easy
to whip up a script to do the transfer. The big difference for me was that
Pelican had you organize your posts by category, while Tinkerer has you organize
them by date. Aside form that they seemed to have roughly the same features
with Tinkerer having full Sphinx support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll see if I continue to like it as time goes on. Thats all for now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adventures in Django Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Nothing to eye opening here but I wanted to collect some thoughts and insights
I had this week. While I&amp;rsquo;m more of an operations guy, a while back I hacked
up a &lt;code&gt;Django&lt;/code&gt; based web application which uses &lt;code&gt;Celery&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/code&gt;. I have
recent set out to do some performance analysis on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not an application that sees much traffic as it was created to serve a niche
internal purpose, but it does handle web requests which result in potentially
long running background tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few pages and process that are painfully slow. So this week I set
out to improve some of slower components of the application. I felt like I had
a pretty good idea of what sucked and why but I wanted to gather some metrics
first so I could understand if the changes I was going to make were the right
changes to make. As of today, I&amp;rsquo;ve not made any code changes to improve
performance, but I wanted to collect my observations after having adding some
instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-relic-integration&#34;&gt;New Relic Integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work &lt;code&gt;New Relic&lt;/code&gt; has been getting a lot of buzz for the magic it works on
Java based applications. I was aware they had some &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; integration, but
up until this week I had not looked too closely at it. To be fair I still don&amp;rsquo;t
think I&amp;rsquo;ve spent enough time reading all their documentation to fully appreciate
all they have to offer, as I was pretty focused on integration with my &lt;code&gt;Django&lt;/code&gt;
application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed was my &amp;laquo;google-foo&amp;raquo; was failing on producing anything
useful.  I got as far as &lt;a href=&#34;http://newrelic.com/python/django&#34;&gt;http://newrelic.com/python/django&lt;/a&gt; which is a great
marketing page, but I needed the technical know-how on how to hook things up.
(I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;code&gt;New Relic&lt;/code&gt; noob all the way around). What I thought was interesting here is
once I did find their documentation it was tremendous, so it was odd that my
searches had been coming up so dry&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read through the bits and pieces on &lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com/docs/python/&#34;&gt;https://newrelic.com/docs/python/&lt;/a&gt;.
I was starting to get pretty excited as this looked like it was going to be really
easy. &lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com/docs/python/python-agent-integration&#34;&gt;https://newrelic.com/docs/python/python-agent-integration&lt;/a&gt; seemed to have
all the key pieces I needed, so I got to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run my application under a &lt;code&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; so I added &lt;code&gt;newrelic&lt;/code&gt; to my
requirements.txt and ran a quick &lt;code&gt;pip install -r requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The
package was installed without any issues. No crazy dependencies and no compile
errors (which are all to uncommon when installing packages with pip).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up for me was getting the agent registered with my web server
(Apache running mod_wsgi). They offer several ways of doing doing things, but I
settled on the &lt;em&gt;Manual integration with code&lt;/em&gt; approach. So I added the following
to my wsgi script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;try:
    import newrelic.agent
    try:
        nr_conf = os.path.join(project_folder, &amp;quot;conf&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;newrelic-django.conf&amp;quot;)
        newrelic.agent.initialize(nr_conf)
    except newrelic.api.exceptions.ConfigurationError:
        logger.warn(&amp;quot;Failed loading New Relic config: {0}&amp;quot;.format(nr_conf))
except ImportError:
    logger.error(&amp;quot;Failed to import newrelic agent&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deviates just a touch from their example so let me explain the key pieces
here. &lt;code&gt;project_folder&lt;/code&gt; is a variable that was already in my wsgi_script and
is simply the path to where all my code lives. I&amp;rsquo;m storing the &lt;code&gt;newrelic-django.conf&lt;/code&gt;
in a &lt;code&gt;conf&lt;/code&gt; sub-folder. The examples on the &lt;code&gt;New Relic&lt;/code&gt; site worked, but for
me I wanted to be sure that if anything was wrong with the agent or the
configuration file it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hinder my apps ability to start. As a result I
wrapped their example with some try/except blocks and logging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2-3 minutes after restarting Apache on my local development VM where I
was testing this, I started seeing very detailed statistics in &lt;code&gt;New Relic&lt;/code&gt;.
I was in awe for several minutes at the insane level of detail they were able
to collect including database query times and mapping out my downstream
dependencies. It was truly amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did however notice that none of my &lt;code&gt;Celery&lt;/code&gt; tasks were getting any information.
I did recall I had read that had to be handle separately. So this lead me
to &lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com/docs/python/python-agent-and-celery&#34;&gt;https://newrelic.com/docs/python/python-agent-and-celery&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m running
&lt;code&gt;Celery&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code&gt;runit&lt;/code&gt; so I had to update my run script. In the process I learned
a little more about runit and environment variables (I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty new to
using &lt;code&gt;runit&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;a href=&#34;http://smarden.org/runit/chpst.8.html&#34;&gt;http://smarden.org/runit/chpst.8.html&lt;/a&gt; is where they discuss this
but for me it was not immediately clear. Here is what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a new directory in the &lt;em&gt;same directory&lt;/em&gt; as my run script. I named it
&lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; directory I created a file called &lt;code&gt;NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I populated &lt;code&gt;env/NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE&lt;/code&gt; with the path to my configuration
file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now when &lt;code&gt;runit&lt;/code&gt; kicks off my celeryd process it will have the proper
environment variable set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now it was time to update my run script. Here is what it looked like before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;exec /usr/bin/env chpst -u myapps_user \
  path_to_virtualenv/bin/python \
  path_to_my_code/manage.py \
  celeryd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is what it looked like after. As you can see not all that different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;	exec /usr/bin/env chpst -e env -u myapps_user \
	  path_to_virtualenv/bin/python \
	  path_to_virtualenv/bin/newrelic-admin run-program \
	  path_to_virtualenv/bin/python \
	  path_to_my_code/manage.py \
	  celeryd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restarted my service and sure enough in just a minute or two I had stats showing
up in &lt;code&gt;New Relic&lt;/code&gt;. I will say it didn&amp;rsquo;t have quite the awe inspiring level of
detail that the web application had, but still pretty awesome for making 0 code
changes, and simply starting up using their wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was it, up and running in about about 1.5 hours including time to read
the documentation. Lets ship it!!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rolled out my updated code to QA and started seeing &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt;. WTF&amp;hellip;.
Trolling through the logs I found this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;newrelic.core.data_collector WARNING - Data collector is not contactable via the proxy host &#39;myproxyhost&#39; on port 8080 with proxy user of None. This can be because of a network issue or because of the data collector being restarted. In the event that contact cannot be made after a period of time then please report this problem to New Relic support for further investigation. The error raised was SSLError(SSLError(SSLError(&#39;_ssl.c:489: The handshake operation timed out&#39;,),),).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I was prepared a bit for this as I knew I&amp;rsquo;d be running behind a proxy server
so I had planned for this and included proxy configuration in my configuration
INI file. Assuming I had done something wrong I reviewed the proxy related
information in &lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com/docs/python/python-agent-configuration&#34;&gt;https://newrelic.com/docs/python/python-agent-configuration&lt;/a&gt;.
Everything looked correct. Typical debugging ensues without any luck. So I
start hacking a ton of debugging output into their agent code and learned that
the HTTP end point I&amp;rsquo;m failing on is &lt;code&gt;https://collector.newrelic.com/agent_listener/invoke_raw_method&lt;/code&gt;.
Using curl from the command line I&amp;rsquo;m able to confirm proxy connectivity is
working. Several more WTF&amp;rsquo;s follow.. While I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to fully understand
all the moving pieces I was able to see their agent is using the requests library
and the dictionary they were passing for proxies looked different than the
&lt;code&gt;examples on the requests site &amp;lt;http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newrelic agent was using &lt;code&gt;{&#39;https&#39;: &#39;myproxyhost:8080&#39;}&lt;/code&gt;,
however requests shows it as &lt;code&gt;{&#39;https&#39;: &#39;http://myproxyhost:8080&#39;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how I had my agent INI originally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ini&#34;&gt; proxy_host = myproxyhost
 proxy_port = 8080
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I changed it to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ini&#34;&gt;proxy_host = http://myproxyhost
proxy_port = 8080
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a restart everything was working fine and I was seeing stats from my
nodes behind my proxy server. Success!!. While I think this is actually a bug
in their agent code, I was happy to see I would work around it with a
configuration change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;memcached-vs-locmem&#34;&gt;Memcached Vs Locmem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few instances of my application running and early on I had added some
&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; basic caching. Early on there was only a single instance so I thought
I was doing myself a favor by keeping things simple and using the &lt;code&gt;locmem&lt;/code&gt;
cache backend. When the time came to scale up to more instances I knew this was
not the best approach as cache was not being shared across instances and if
wanted to run with multiple Apache processes those processes, even though there
under the same instance of Apache, were not actually sharing cache. I should note
that the reason for adding more instances wasn&amp;rsquo;t load related, but simply to
avoid having a single point of failure. So at that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t explore
switching to Memcached as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to change anything, I just
wanted more instances to avoid the SPF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward and I figured since I&amp;rsquo;m focused on the subject let me eliminate
what I know is an inefficiency and switch to Memcached so all my instances
are now sharing cache. Since I had recently hooked up New Relic I had some
really great statistics. I could see, on average, one of the more frequent
pages of the application were taking about 2 seconds (horrible I know.. I knew it
was slow, but was ashamed when I saw just how slow it really was).  So I updated
my configuration to use a &lt;strong&gt;remote&lt;/strong&gt; (not on the same box) Memcached cluster.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t make any other changes to code or configuration, yet as soon as I rolled
out I saw an average of about 700ms reduction in response time. That warrants
repeating&amp;hellip;. &lt;strong&gt;Doing nothing except changing from locmem to Memcached resulted
in around 700ms of reduced page load time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not suggesting that locmem is bad. In fact, when I first implemented it
made a pretty large improvement, but it was very interesting see to how much
of an improvement Memcached made, considering we were going from in process
cache to an external (across the network) cache. My take away from this was
that there are cases were a remote cache can actually be more beneficial than
a local cache, if your sharing information across many instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;celery-apply-vs-apply-async&#34;&gt;Celery apply vs apply_async&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I poked at this week was usage of &lt;code&gt;Celery&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;apply()&lt;/code&gt; method
vs &lt;code&gt;apply_aysync&lt;/code&gt;. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know the difference, &lt;code&gt;apply_async&lt;/code&gt;
will drop a message onto the queue and wait for celeryd to process it
asynchronously. Using &lt;code&gt;apply()&lt;/code&gt; is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Execute this task locally, by blocking until the task returns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was curious what sort of overhead was involved in the process of dropping the
message onto the queue. I created a task that did no actual work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;from celery.task import task

@task
def test_task():
    pass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I timed the calls to both &lt;code&gt;apply()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;apply_aysync&lt;/code&gt;. On my
system, where &lt;code&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/code&gt; is running on the same box (so no network hops
involved in this test), &lt;code&gt;apply()&lt;/code&gt; would run the task in about 3-4ms while
&lt;code&gt;apply_aysync&lt;/code&gt; ranged between 13-16ms with occasional anomalies of 30-34ms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my purposes this is plenty fast enough, but I was a little surprised to
see that level of overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, it was an interesting set of exercises and for the most part
confirmed many of my suspicions, but its nice to finally have some real
metrics around this. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m measuring all this great stuff its time to
start improving it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chef Minitest and Slow Starting Web Application</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/chef/chef_minitest_and_slow_starting_web_application/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>dave@petzel.email (David Petzel)</author>
      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/chef/chef_minitest_and_slow_starting_web_application/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have started to become proficient with &lt;code&gt;Chef&lt;/code&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve also gotten used to
using the &lt;code&gt;minitest-chef-handler&lt;/code&gt; for writing integration tests for my
cookbooks. This quick post is to capture an approach I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to like for
doing HTTP tests of slow starting web applications. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that many
services will return from an &lt;code&gt;/sbin/service mysapp start&lt;/code&gt; well before
the application has fully started and is accepting HTTP connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I taken a very naive approach of timing how long the app took
to startup, adding some arbitrary number of seconds and then just sleeping that
long before testing. This is of course a stupid approach and now that I&amp;rsquo;ve
gotten my feet wet with both &lt;code&gt;Chef&lt;/code&gt; and Ruby I&amp;rsquo;ve learned of a really simply
approach to poll the service frequently and eventually giving up or succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the approach I am using these days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;require &#39;minitest/spec&#39;
require &amp;quot;net/http&amp;quot;

describe_recipe &#39;mycookbook::myrecipe&#39; do
  include MiniTest::Chef::Assertions
  include MiniTest::Chef::Context
  include MiniTest::Chef::Resources
  it &amp;quot;listens on the desired HTTP Port&amp;quot; do
    begin
      tries ||= 12
      http_port = node[:myapp][:http_port]
      response = Net::HTTP.get_response(node[:ipaddress], &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;, http_port)
    rescue
      Chef::Log.info(&amp;quot;HTTP listner is not available yet&amp;quot;)
      sleep(5)
      retry unless (tries -= 1).zero?
    end
    response.must_be_kind_of(Net::HTTPOK)
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets break this down a bit:
* The first couple of lines are boiler plate imports. We will be leveraging
  some spec tests and using the net/http library in our tests.
* Line 4 starts a describe_recipe block (which ends on 20).
* Lines 5-7 include some bits from &lt;code&gt;Minitest::Chef&lt;/code&gt;. In general you should
  move these out to a helper module, but thats out of the scope of this post.
  For the purposes of this post just know you need to have them in order for
  this to work properly (I actually think the only one that is really required
  is &lt;code&gt;MiniTest::Chef::Context&lt;/code&gt;, but all the examples you find tend to include
  all 3, so I&amp;rsquo;m leaving them as I don&amp;rsquo;t believe there is much harm in including
  and not using them.
* Line 8 starts another block (which ends on line 19) which is essentially a
  description of what we will be testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the items I just described are pretty generic for tests. They are
not directly related to the purpose of this post, but I include them for the
purpose of a complete example. Now lets look a little closer at the bits that
do the test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;begin
  tries ||= 12
  http_port = node[:myapp][:http_port]
  response = Net::HTTP.get_response(node[:ipaddress], &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;, http_port)
rescue
  Chef::Log.debug(&amp;quot;HTTP listner is not available yet&amp;quot;)
  sleep(5)
  retry unless (tries -= 1).zero?
end
response.must_be_kind_of(Net::HTTPOK)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By wrapping everything in a begin/rescue block we can leverage Ruby&amp;rsquo;s built-in
&lt;code&gt;retry&lt;/code&gt; statement which I also just recently learned about and has allowed
me to cleanup a good bit of self-rolled retry logic I&amp;rsquo;ve written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m certainly no Ruby expert so the following explanation is how I understand
these pieces to work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 2 reads &amp;laquo;Use the current value of the variable &lt;code&gt;tries&lt;/code&gt;. If the variable
is not currently set, start with a value of &lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;raquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next we are going to fetch the HTTP port from a node attribute. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen examples
were folks bake the HTTP port into the test, but I prefer using a node attribute
so that my recipe can configure the application on that port and my test will
use that same port. In the future if I ever change the port, I don&amp;rsquo;t need
to update the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line 4 is going to invoke an HTTP request to the path of &amp;laquo;/&amp;raquo; on the local node
using its IP address (rather than localhost or 127.0.0.1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes the real magic. When something goes wrong (IE the application is not
accepting HTTP connections yet) we hit the rescue block. When that happens the
following occurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log a debug level message that we haven&amp;rsquo;t finished starting yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for 5 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally the magic wand in the equation&amp;hellip; Line 8 reads &amp;laquo;decrement the
value of the tries variable by one (12 - 1 = 11). After decrementing the
variable check if the variable is equal to 0. If it is not, retry the code
that was in the begin section (lines 2-4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this block will check if the application is accepting HTTP connections once
every 5 seconds for a maximum of 12 tries (one minute). If at
any point we get an HTTP response, it stops trying. Additionally if we have
not gotten a response in 12 attempts we also stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to not wait for 60 seconds when the app usually takes 10 seconds
to start, but may sometimes take 25-30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, line 10 registers the assertion with minitest. We are asserting
that the response is going to be instance of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTPOK.html&#34;&gt;Net::OK&lt;/a&gt;.
Had we hit our maximum number of retries this would have been nil and failed.
Additionally if for some reason we got some sort of HTTP error this would
also fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as I mentioned earlier there are other ways to accomplish this but I like
this approach as its pretty easy to understand for someone that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know
Ruby all that well (ME!), and has the benefit of not waiting too much longer
than necessary when waiting for a service to start.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello Pelican</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/hello_pelican/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>dave@petzel.email (David Petzel)</author>
      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/hello_pelican/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve gone live with a static site using &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.getpelican.com&#34;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
Originally I had kicked off my attempts at a static site using Mynt, which I
detailed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dpetzel.info/post/live_with_mynt/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There really wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything
wrong with Mynt, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right to me after having trying to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I decided to make the switch was Pelicans themes. I don&amp;rsquo;t
have a single artistic or stylish cell in my body, so I heavily rely on themes
by people who are good at making things look good. I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t find
many themes at all for Mynt, while Pelican has a pretty nice collection in their
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes&#34;&gt;Pelican Themes Repo&lt;/a&gt;, which is
where I found this one (attributed in the footer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing was the directory layout just seems more &amp;laquo;me&amp;raquo;. I know that sounds
dumb, but I&amp;rsquo;m a believer in picking tools that fit your style, assuming the
technical merits are all the same. This was most certainly a case of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much else to report, just wanted to get the traditional &amp;laquo;hello world&amp;raquo; post
out there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running Uptime on Heroku</title>
      <link>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/cloud/running_uptime_on_heroku/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>dave@petzel.email (David Petzel)</author>
      <guid>http://www.dpetzel.info/post/cloud/running_uptime_on_heroku/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For today&amp;rsquo;s adventure I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to finally get my hands dirty with
&lt;a href=&#34;http://heroku.com&#34;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve know about it for a while now, and have gone
so far as reading some of the documentation, however I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually
tried using it. So today, I decided to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: If you don&amp;rsquo;t really care how I got there, skip to the &amp;laquo;Condensed&amp;raquo;
section for the bare bones info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;long-version&#34;&gt;Long Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my first question was what should I run. I&amp;rsquo;m not really in a coding
mood today so I figured I would pick something someone else has already
written. Earlier this week a colleague of mine turned me onto &lt;code&gt;Uptime&lt;/code&gt;_
so I figured, what the heck its as good as any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little more digging, I found that there were enough free pieces
to Heroku that I should be able to run this experiment at no charge.
Bonus!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the reading started with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs&#34;&gt;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/amree/5884081&#34;&gt;https://gist.github.com/amree/5884081&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That link the gist was superhelpful, however I didn&amp;rsquo;t really care for
the fact that the credentials would be stored in the configuration
file. After a little more digging I ended up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest/&#34;&gt;http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest/&lt;/a&gt;.
The key piece of information on this page was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environment variables can be used to override file configurations. Any environment variable that starts with $CONFIG_ is set into the CONFIG object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recalled reading in the Heroku docs that I could set environment
variables for my application. So at this point I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve got
enough information to get started. Here we go&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was sign up for a Heroku account from their
front page. I must say this was one of the easiest signup processes
I have ever seen. I also thought it was interesting (only because it was
different) that during the sign up process you don&amp;rsquo;t create your password
until AFTER you get your verification email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I installed the Heroku toolbelt (I&amp;rsquo;m doing this testing on a
Linux Mint workstation):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;wget -qO- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That couldn&amp;rsquo;t have been any No more errors!! I think we are in business finally.easier.. So now I cloned the Uptime github repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime.git
cd uptime
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I logged into Heroku:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku login
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a brand new test workstation I&amp;rsquo;m using so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any
ssh keys configured yet. Heroku appears to take care of that as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Could not find an existing public key.
Would you like to generate one? [Yn] Y
Generating new SSH public key.
Uploading SSH public key /home/dave/.ssh/id_rsa.pub... done
Authentication successful.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m assuming had I already had keys, this would have been skipped..
From there I setup the application in Heroku:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku create my-uptime
Creating my-uptime... done, stack is cedar
http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:my-uptime.git
Git remote heroku added
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So things interesting at this step happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The name I originally chose came back with &lt;code&gt;!    Name is already taken&lt;/code&gt;.
This seems to indicate that two people can&amp;rsquo;t have the same application.
Interesting, but no big deal as some simple name prefixing would easy
solve this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It automatically created a new git remote for me. This was pretty cool
In some of the reading I did I kept seeing references to
&lt;code&gt;git push heroku master&lt;/code&gt;, and I was wondering why none of them
references creating the remote. Now I know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to add in support for MongoDB (which uptime uses). This was
the first actual issue I ran into. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it was in the docs somewhere
but I must have missed it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku addons:add mongolab
Adding mongolab on my-uptime... failed
 !    Please verify your account to install this add-on
 !    For more information, see http://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/billing
 !    Verify now at https://heroku.com/verify
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitting that verify page I was prompted for my credit card info. Wait
a minute&amp;hellip; I could have sworn I read that the &lt;code&gt;Mongo HQ&lt;/code&gt; addon said
I could use the &lt;strong&gt;MongoHQ Sandbox&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. And then I found this:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification&#34;&gt;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes a requirement once you wish to use add-ons other than
  postgresql:dev or pgbackups:plus–even if the add-ons are free. This is because
  some features (most notably outgoing email and  custom domains) carry a
  potential for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, that seems fair. I accommodated and gave them my CC info. Now lets
try adding Mongo support again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku addons:add mongolab
Adding mongolab on my-uptime... done, v3 (free)
Welcome to MongoLab.  Your new subscription is being created and will be available shortly.  Please consult the MongoLab Add-on Admin UI to check on its progress.
Use `heroku addons:docs mongolab` to view documentation.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much better!! Next I created the &lt;strong&gt;Procfile&lt;/strong&gt;. Which seems to instruct
Heroku &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to run the application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;echo &amp;quot;web: node web.js&amp;quot; &amp;gt; Procfile
git add Procfile
git commit -m &amp;quot;adding Procfile&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is where my path and that of the gist I was following started
to diverge a little bit. The gist talks about hacking up the config
file, while I want to use environment variables. So the first thing
I did was fetch my mongo connection info:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config
=== my-uptime Config Vars
MONGOLAB_URI: mongodb://heroku_app########:randomchars@host.mongolab.com:12345/heroku_app########
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that I&amp;rsquo;m able to figure out the following connection information&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Host = host.mongolab.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Port = 12345&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database User = heroku_app########&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Password = randomchars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Name = heroku_app######## (Seems to match my username, not
sure if that is always the case or not)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so from here I know I can see my username will be &lt;code&gt;heroku_app########&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;
and my password will be&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;randomchars&lt;/code&gt;`. Now lets set those in environment
variables so I can safely commit my stuff to github without giving
away the keys to the kingdom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb.server=host.mongolab.com:12345
heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb.database=heroku_app########
heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb.user=heroku_app########
heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb.password=randomchars
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, In theory that should handle our configuration. I think I&amp;rsquo;m ready
to push the app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git push heroku master
... a bunch of output ending in..

-----&amp;gt; Compiled slug size: 24.3MB
-----&amp;gt; Launching... done, v9
       http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku

To git@heroku.com:my-uptime.git
 * [new branch]      master -&amp;gt; master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK that seems to have gone smoothly, I guess its time to start it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku ps:scale web=1
Scaling web dynos... done, now running 1
```No more errors!! I think we are in business finallyNo more errors!! I think we are in business finally.

OK, seems like it should be running...:
```shell
heroku ps
=== web (1X): `node web.js`
web.1: crashed 2013/09/08 16:20:03 (~ 5m ago)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also confirmed, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hit the application on the default port of
8082&amp;hellip; So now we dive into what went wrong&amp;hellip;. Running &lt;code&gt;heroku --help&lt;/code&gt;
yields there is a logs subcommand. Amongst the chaos of that output I
find this line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Error: Cannot find module &#39;/app/web.js&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out there is a comment on that gist which indicates we&amp;rsquo;ve used
the wrong js module. Lets fix that up and re-push:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;echo web: node app.js &amp;gt; Procfile
git add Procfile
git commit -m &amp;quot;fixing module name&amp;quot;
git push heroku master
..the same lots of output as last time we pushed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it working now?:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku ps
=== web (1X): `node app.js`
web.1: crashed 2013/09/08 16:32:11 (~ 1m ago)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;doh!. what now&amp;hellip;Using &lt;code&gt;heroku logs&lt;/code&gt;. I find this line now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;MongoDB error: failed to connect to [localhost:27017]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm.. Localhost and 27017 (the default mongodb port). Neither of those
are the values I set in my environment variables&amp;hellip;. Lets look into
that. Running &lt;code&gt;heroku config&lt;/code&gt; shows that my named spaced ENV vars
didn&amp;rsquo;t actually take, and instead they were all applied at the root
level:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config
=== my-uptime Config Vars
.database:    heroku_app########
.password:    randomchars
.server:      host.mongolab.com:12345
.user:        heroku_app########
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back to the drawing board on assigning those config values&amp;hellip;
A re-read of &lt;a href=&#34;http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest/&#34;&gt;http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest/&lt;/a&gt; yields
I&amp;rsquo;m dumb and can&amp;rsquo;t read&amp;hellip;. I should use underscores not dots to
delimit my vars&amp;hellip; Lets try this again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb_password=randomchars
Setting config vars and restarting my-uptime... failed
 !    Config var key must not be empty.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, doesn&amp;rsquo;t like that&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the leading dollar sign in the
docs shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used when setting this, trying it a different way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config:set CONFIG_mongodb_password=randomchars
Setting config vars and restarting mp-uptime... done, v13
CONFIG_mongodb_password: randomchars
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks better&amp;hellip;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config
=== mp-uptime Config Vars
.database:               heroku_app########
.password:               randomchars
.server:                 host.mongolab.com:12345
.user:                   heroku_app########
CONFIG_mongodb_password: randomchars
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further, lets clean up my previous mess before I forget
about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config:unset .database .password .server .user
Unsetting .database and restarting my-uptime... done, v14
Unsetting .password and restarting my-uptime... done, v15
Unsetting .server and restarting my-uptime... done, v16
Unsetting .user and restarting my-uptime... done, v17
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect, mess removed, now lets set up the new ones&amp;hellip;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config:set CONFIG_mongodb_server=host.mongolab.com:12345 CONFIG_mongodb_datbase=heroku_app######## CONFIG_mongodb_user=heroku_app########
Setting config vars and restarting my-uptime... done, v18
CONFIG_mongodb_database: heroku_app########
CONFIG_mongodb_server:   host.mongolab.com:12345
CONFIG_mongodb_user:     heroku_app########
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;heroku logs&lt;/code&gt; yields the same issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;MongoDB error: failed to connect to [localhost:27017]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly I&amp;rsquo;m not doing something right with these environment variables
Some trial and error that isn&amp;rsquo;t all that beneficial ensues&amp;hellip;
After a couple hours of back tracking and seconding guessing, I finally
figured this out&amp;hellip;. It turns out that the vFrom the terminal::ersion of the
config module that supports the environment variable stuff is newer than what
is declared in uptime&amp;rsquo;s package.json so it was being ignored!!.
So edit package.json and replaced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;config&amp;quot;:    &amp;quot;0.4.15&amp;quot;,
with
&amp;quot;config&amp;quot;:    &amp;quot;0.4.27&amp;quot;,
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also figured out by looking through the node-config code that the
env var prefix should be &lt;strong&gt;CONFIG&lt;/strong&gt; not &lt;strong&gt;$CONFIG&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So lets get things rolling again&amp;hellip;. First ensure are ENV vars are set:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config:set CONFIG_mongodb_server=host.mongolab.com:12345 CONFIG_mongodb_datbase=heroku_app######## CONFIG_mongodb_user=heroku_app######## CONFIG_mongodb_password=randomchars
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we have to push our application update using our new package.json:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git add package.json
git commit -m &amp;quot;bump config dependency&amp;quot;
git push heroku master
..the same lots of output as last time we pushed
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what do you know, I can hit the web interface via &lt;a href=&#34;http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com&#34;&gt;http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com&lt;/a&gt;.
Progress!! But all is not perfect yet..&lt;code&gt;heroku logs&lt;/code&gt; yields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;[Error: http://localhost:8082/api/checks/needingPoll resource not available: connect ECONNREFUSED]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets see about fixing that up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;heroku config:set CONFIG_monitor_apiUrl=&#39;http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com/api&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more errors!! I think we are in business finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;condensed-version&#34;&gt;Condensed Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clone the Repo::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime.git
cd uptime
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Log into Heroku::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku login
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the app::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku create my-uptime
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Mongo support::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku addons:add mongolab
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show Mongo Connection Info::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set connection info into environment variables (to keep them out of
configuration files) as well as other config options::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku config:set CONFIG_mongodb_server=host.mongolab.com:12345 CONFIG_mongodb_datbase=heroku_app######## CONFIG_mongodb_user=heroku_app######## CONFIG_mongodb_password=randomchars CONFIG_monitor_apiUrl=&#39;http://yourapp.herokuapp.com/api&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit package.json and replace::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;config&amp;quot;:    &amp;quot;0.4.15&amp;quot;,
with
&amp;quot;config&amp;quot;:    &amp;quot;0.4.27&amp;quot;,
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the Procfile::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;echo web: node app.js &amp;gt; Procfile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploy it::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git add .
git commit -m &amp;quot;adjustments&amp;quot;
git push heroku master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start it up with one dyno (the free tier)::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku ps:scale web=1
Scaling web dynos... done, now running 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verify::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;heroku logs --tail
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
