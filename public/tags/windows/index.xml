      <description>Nothing to exciting here, but its the 3rd or 4th time in recent history I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go looking for this, so I figured I would write it down finally.
There are times when a domain attached PC has RDP disabled for some reason. The following snippet, which I adapted from http://oreilly.com/windows/archive/server-hacks-remote-desktop.html makes it a little quicker. Run this from a cmd prompt as a user with admin rights on the remote host.</description>

      <description>A while back a co-worker told me about Chocolately. I had taken a quick look and it seemed interesting, but I kind of forgot about it after that.
Well today, I was setting up a new machine and I had a handful of things I wanted to install. I was thinking to myself what a bummer it was going to be to have fire up Google and search for each of the package’s download sites.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been tasked with migrating a Windows 2003 Small Business Server to Windows 2013 Standard.
Without getting into too much of the back story, the client purchased Windows 2003 SBS many moons ago, however they never leveraged anything except Active Directory and File Sharing. They use their hosting provider&amp;rsquo;s web mail, and don&amp;rsquo;t have an appetite to change that.
Here are we many moons later and they are ready to upgrade.</description>
