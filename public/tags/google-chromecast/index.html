		<p>I finally got around to picking up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast">Chromecast</a>. I had read some reviews
so I didn&rsquo;t have any high expectations, but I couldn&rsquo;t resist the urge to
tinker with it given its price point. Boy was I disappointed&hellip;.</p>

<p>The instructions it came with made it look like it was going to be the easiest thing
I ever hooked up. The physical hookup was simple enough, but then it came time
to get it hooked up to my wireless. I don&rsquo;t have anything fancy, just a Linksys
E3200 with <code>WPA2/WPA Mixed Mode</code> security. I&rsquo;ve hooked up a ton of devices
and never had any issues.</p>

<p>The Chromecast App was useless. It could see my Chromecast, but I
just kept getting a grey exclamation mark with a message saying it couldn&rsquo;t
connect. I went back and forth with the online help and the only useful thing
I found was the link to the web based setup instructions located at
<a href="https://cast.google.com/chromecast/setup?np=manualsetup">https://cast.google.com/chromecast/setup?np=manualsetup</a>. With this I was able
able to get a little further. I got as far as it displaying a 4 letter code
for me to confirm. Once I did that, it failed to connect again. What!?!?!
You can <strong>obviously</strong> connect, since you just synced up that 4 letter code!!!
A bunch of google searching and nothing useful. Finally for no good reason other than
a lucky guess, I changed the network type on my Laptop &ndash;&gt; Chromecast wifi
network from Public to Home.</p>

<p>Once I made that switch the Web based setup got a little bit further and it
prompted me for my wireless password. Entered and it failed to connect&hellip;
For kicks I tried the application again, it was still useless, so back to the
web based setup.</p>

<p>I ended up having to power off the Chromecast one more time and then running
through the setup wizard again. Finally I had it hooked up the wireless. While
I can appreciate the target audience probably needs the &laquo;magic config&raquo; I really
wish they would have just given me the &laquo;I know what the eff I&rsquo;m doing&raquo; option
and just entered my wifi info directly.</p>

<p>Once I had it connected, the native casting support in YouTube worked really well
I have a YouTube app native on my TV and the quality of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromecast">Chromecast</a> was
better than the native app. Sadly, the &laquo;cast my Chrome tab&raquo; option didn&rsquo;t have
the same quality. I tried to play a recent episode of the
<a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/">The Big Bang Theory</a>,
but the quality was terrible and it kept freezing. It was not watchable.</p>

<p>The next test I did was to stream the Thursday Night Football game from nfl.com
This was a little better but still pretty choppy. I was able to reduce the
choppiness by dropping the quality down to 480p. Given that I cut the cord a
while back, the fact that I was able to watch a game that was not broadcast
on one of the national network channels was pretty cool. The game was watchable
(its playing as I write this), but its certainly not a great experience.</p>

<p>So at the end of the day, the only thing I would consider a success was the YouTube
integration, but given I have the YouTube native app on my TV, I really don&rsquo;t feel like
I gained anything. If your a techy/gadget person its worth the $35 as something fun
to play with, but as of right now I struggle to see it being a valuable addition
to my media consumption choices.</p>
