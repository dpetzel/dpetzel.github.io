Hello Pelican

So I've `gone live` with a static site using `Pelican`_. Originally I had kicked
off my attempts at a static site using Mynt, which I detailed 
`Here <|filename|Live_with_mynt.rst>`_. There really wasn't anything wrong with
Mynt, it just didn't feel right to me after having trying to use it.

One of the reasons I decided to make the switch was Pelicans themes. I don't
have a single artistic or stylish cell in my body, so I heavily rely on themes
by people who are good at making things look good. I really couldn't find
many themes at all for Mynt, while Pelican has a pretty nice collection in their
`Pelican Themes Repo`_, which is where I found this one (attributed in the 
footer).

The other thing was the directory layout just seems more "me". I know that sounds
dumb, but I'm a believer in picking tools that fit your style, assuming the 
technical merits are all the same. This was most certainly a case of that.

Not much else to report, just wanted to get the traditional "hello world" post
out there...
