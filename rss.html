<h1>Adventures in Django Performance Analysis</h1>
<p>Nothing to eye opening here but I wanted to collect some thoughs and insights
I had this week. While I’m more of an operations guy, a while back I hacked
up a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> based web application which uses <a class="reference external" href="http://www.celeryproject.org">Celery</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a>.</p>

<h1>Chef Minitest and Slow Starting Web Application</h1>
<p>As I have started to become proficient with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opscode.com/chef">Chef</a> I’ve also gotten used to
using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/calavera/minitest-chef-handler">minitest-chef-handler</a> for writing integration tests for my
cookbooks. This quick post is to capture an approach I’ve grown to like for
doing HTTP tests of slow starting web applications. I’ve noticed that many
services will return from an <cite>/sbin/service mysapp start</cite> well before
the application has fully started and is accepting HTTP connections.</p>

<h1>Running Uptime on Heroku</h1>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you don’t really care how I got there, skip to the
“Condensed” section for the bare bones info.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-process">
<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>For today’s adventure I’ve decided to finally get my hands dirty
with <a class="reference external" href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. I’ve know about it for a while now, and have gone so
far as reading some of the documentation, however I’ve never actually
tried using it. So today, I decided to change that.</p>
<p>So my first question was what should I run. I’m not really in a coding
mood today so I figured I would pick something someone else has already
written. Earlier this week a colleague of mine turned me onto <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime">Uptime</a>
so I figured, what the heck its as good as any.</p>
<p>After a little more digging, I found that there were enough free pieces
to Heroku that I should be able to run this experiment at no charge.
Bonus!!</p>
<p>So the reading started with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/amree/5884081">https://gist.github.com/amree/5884081</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That link the gist was superhelpful, however I didn’t really care for
the fact that the credentials would be stored in the configuration
file. After a little more digging I ended up on <a class="reference external" href="http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest">http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest/</a>. The key piece of information on this page was:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Environment variables can be used to override file configurations. Any environment variable that starts with $CONFIG_ is set into the CONFIG object.</pre>
</div>
<p>I recalled reading in the Heroku docs that I could set environment
variables for my application. So at this point I feel like I’ve got
enough information to get started. Here we go...</p>
<p>The first thing I did was sign up for a Heroku account from their
front page. I must say this was one of the easiest signup processes
I have ever seen. I also thought it was interesting (only because it was
different) that during the sign up process you don’t create your password
until AFTER you get your verification email.</p>
<p>Next I installed the Heroku toolbelt (I’m doing this testing on a
Linux Mint workstation):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>wget -qO- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh</pre>
</div>
<p>That couldn’t have been any easier.. So now I cloned the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime">Uptime</a>
github repo:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>git clone https://github.com/fzaninotto/uptime.git
cd uptime</pre>
</div>
<p>Next I logged into Heroku:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku login</pre>
</div>
<p>This is a brand new test workstation I’m using so I didn’t have any
ssh keys configured yet. Heroku appears to take care of that as well:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Could not find an existing public key.
Would you like to generate one? [Yn] Y
Generating new SSH public key.
Uploading SSH public key /home/dave/.ssh/id_rsa.pub... done
Authentication successful.</pre>
</div>
<p>I’m assuming had I already had keys, this would have been skipped..
From there I setup the application in Heroku:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku create my-uptime
Creating my-uptime... done, stack is cedar
http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:my-uptime.git
Git remote heroku added</pre>
</div>
<p>So things interesting at this step happened:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The name I originally chose came back with <cite>!    Name is already taken</cite>.
This seems to indicate that two people can’t have the same application.
Interesting, but no big deal as some simple name prefixing would easy
solve this</li>
<li>It automatically created a new git remote for me. This was pretty cool
In some of the reading I did I kept seeing references to
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span> <span class="pre">heroku</span> <span class="pre">master</span></span>, and I was wondering why none of them
references creating the remote. Now I know.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we need to add in support for MongoDB (which uptime uses). This was
the first actual issue I ran into. I’m sure it was in the docs somewhere
but I must have missed it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku addons:add mongolab
Adding mongolab on my-uptime... failed
 !    Please verify your account to install this add-on
 !    For more information, see http://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/billing
 !    Verify now at https://heroku.com/verify</pre>
</div>
<p>Hitting that verify page I was prompted for my credit card info. Wait
a minute... I could have sworn I read that the <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.heroku.com/mongohq">Mongo HQ</a> addon said
I could use the <strong>MongoHQ Sandbox</strong> for free.... And then I found this:
<a class="reference external" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div>It becomes a requirement once you wish to use add-ons other than
postgresql:dev or pgbackups:plus–even if the add-ons are free.
This is because some features (most notably outgoing email and
custom domains) carry a potential for abuse.</div></blockquote>
<p>OK, that seems fair. I accommodated and gave them my CC info. Now lets
try adding Mongo support again:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku addons:add mongolab
Adding mongolab on my-uptime... done, v3 (free)
Welcome to MongoLab.  Your new subscription is being created and will be available shortly.  Please consult the MongoLab Add-on Admin UI to check on its progress.
Use `heroku addons:docs mongolab` to view documentation.</pre>
</div>
<p>Much better!! Next I created the <strong>Procfile</strong>. Which seems to instruct
Heroku <em>how</em> to run the application:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>echo &quot;web: node web.js&quot; &gt; Procfile
git add Procfile
git commit -m &quot;adding Procfile&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p>So this is where my path and that of the gist I was following started
to diverge a little bit. The gist talks about hacking up the config
file, while I want to use environment variables. So the first thing
I did was fetch my mongo connection info:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config
=== my-uptime Config Vars
MONGOLAB_URI: mongodb://heroku_app########:randomchars@host.mongolab.com:12345/heroku_app########</pre>
</div>
<p>From that I’m able to figure out the following connection information</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Database Host = host.mongolab.com</li>
<li>Database Port = 12345</li>
<li>Database User = heroku_app########</li>
<li>Database Password = randomchars</li>
<li>Database Name = heroku_app######## (Seems to match my username, not
sure if that is always the case or not)</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so from here I know I can see my username will be <cite>heroku_app########`</cite>
and my password will be <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">randomchars</span></span>. Now lets set those in environment
variables so I can safely commit my stuff to github without giving
away the keys to the kingdom:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb.server=host.mongolab.com:12345
heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb.database=heroku_app########
heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb.user=heroku_app########
heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb.password=randomchars</pre>
</div>
<p>OK, In theory that should handle our configuration. I think I’m ready
to push the app:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>git push heroku master
... a bunch of output ending in..

-----&gt; Compiled slug size: 24.3MB
-----&gt; Launching... done, v9
       http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku

To git@heroku.com:my-uptime.git
 * [new branch]      master -&gt; master</pre>
</div>
<p>OK that seems to have gone smoothly, I guess its time to start it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku ps:scale web=1
Scaling web dynos... done, now running 1</pre>
</div>
<p>OK, seems like it should be running...:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku ps
=== web (1X): `node web.js`
web.1: crashed 2013/09/08 16:20:03 (~ 5m ago)</pre>
</div>
<p>Also confirmed, I couldn’t hit the application on the default port of
8082... So now we dive into what went wrong.... Running <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">heroku</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></span>
yields there is a logs subcommand. Amognst the chaos of that output I
find this line:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Error: Cannot find module '/app/web.js'</pre>
</div>
<p>Turns out there is a comment on that gist which indicates we’ve used
the wrong js module. Lets fix that up and re-push:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>echo web: node app.js &gt; Procfile
git add Procfile
git commit -m &quot;fixing module name&quot;
git push heroku master
..the same lots of output as last time we pushed</pre>
</div>
<p>Is it working now?:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku ps
=== web (1X): `node app.js`
web.1: crashed 2013/09/08 16:32:11 (~ 1m ago)</pre>
</div>
<p>doh!. what now...Using <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">heroku</span> <span class="pre">logs</span></span>. I find this line now:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>MongoDB error: failed to connect to [localhost:27017]</pre>
</div>
<p>Hmmm.. Localhost and 27017 (the default mongodb port). Neither of those
are the values I set in my environment variables.... Lets look into
that. Running <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">heroku</span> <span class="pre">config</span></span> shows that my named spaced env vars
didnt actually take, and instead they were all applied at the root
level:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config
=== my-uptime Config Vars
.database:    heroku_app########
.password:    randomchars
.server:      host.mongolab.com:12345
.user:        heroku_app########</pre>
</div>
<p>So back to the drawing board on assigning those config values...
A re-read of <a class="reference external" href="http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest">http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest/</a> yields
I’m dumb and can’t read.... I should use underscores not dots to
delimite my vars... Lets try this again:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config:set $CONFIG_mongodb_password=randomchars
Setting config vars and restarting my-uptime... failed
 !    Config var key must not be empty.</pre>
</div>
<p>OK, doesn’t like that... I’m guessing the leading dollar sign in the
docs shouldn’t be used when setting this, trying it a different way:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config:set CONFIG_mongodb_password=randomchars
Setting config vars and restarting mp-uptime... done, v13
CONFIG_mongodb_password: randomchars</pre>
</div>
<p>Looks better...:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config
=== mp-uptime Config Vars
.database:               heroku_app########
.password:               randomchars
.server:                 host.mongolab.com:12345
.user:                   heroku_app########
CONFIG_mongodb_password: randomchars</pre>
</div>
<p>Before we go any further, lets clean up my previous mess before I forget
about it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config:unset .database .password .server .user
Unsetting .database and restarting my-uptime... done, v14
Unsetting .password and restarting my-uptime... done, v15
Unsetting .server and restarting my-uptime... done, v16
Unsetting .user and restarting my-uptime... done, v17</pre>
</div>
<p>Perfect, mess removed, now lets set up the new ones...:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config:set CONFIG_mongodb_server=host.mongolab.com:12345 CONFIG_mongodb_datbase=heroku_app######## CONFIG_mongodb_user=heroku_app########
Setting config vars and restarting my-uptime... done, v18
CONFIG_mongodb_database: heroku_app########
CONFIG_mongodb_server:   host.mongolab.com:12345
CONFIG_mongodb_user:     heroku_app########</pre>
</div>
<p>Running <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">heroku</span> <span class="pre">logs</span></span> yields the same issue:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>MongoDB error: failed to connect to [localhost:27017]</pre>
</div>
<p>Clearly I’m not doing something right with these environment variables
Some trial and error that isn’t all that benificial ensues...
After a couple hours of back tracking and seconding guessing, I finally
figured this out.... It turns out that the vFrom the terminal::ersion of the config module
that suppors the environment variable stuff is newer than what is declared
in uptime’s package.json so it was being ignored!!. So edit package.json
and replaced:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>&quot;config&quot;:    &quot;0.4.15&quot;,
with
&quot;config&quot;:    &quot;0.4.27&quot;,</pre>
</div>
<p>And I also figured out by looking through the node-config code that the
env var prefix should be <strong>CONFIG</strong> not <strong>$CONFIG</strong>.</p>
<p>So lets get things rolling again.... First ensure are ENV vars are set:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config:set CONFIG_mongodb_server=host.mongolab.com:12345 CONFIG_mongodb_datbase=heroku_app######## CONFIG_mongodb_user=heroku_app######## CONFIG_mongodb_password=randomchars</pre>
</div>
<p># And now we have to push our application update using our new package.json:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>git add package.json
git commit -m &quot;bump config dependency&quot;
git push heroku master
..the same lots of output as last time we pushed</pre>
</div>
<p>And what do you know, I can hit the web interface via <a class="reference external" href="http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com">http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com</a>.
Progress!! But all is not perfect yet..``heroku logs`` yields:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>[Error: http://localhost:8082/api/checks/needingPoll resource not available: connect ECONNREFUSED]</pre>
</div>
<p>Lets see about fixing that up:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>heroku config:set CONFIG_monitor_apiUrl='http://my-uptime.herokuapp.com/api'</pre>
</div>
<p>No more errors!! I think we are in business finally.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="condensed">

<h1>Hello Pelican</h1>
<p>So I’ve <cite>gone live</cite> with a static site using <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com">Pelican</a>. Originally I had kicked
off my attempts at a static site using Mynt, which I detailed
<a class="reference external" href="|filename|Live_with_mynt.rst">Here</a>. There really wasn’t anything wrong with
Mynt, it just didn’t feel right to me after having trying to use it.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I decided to make the switch was Pelicans themes. I don’t
have a single artistic or stylish cell in my body, so I heavily rely on themes
by people who are good at making things look good. I really couldn’t find
many themes at all for Mynt, while Pelican has a pretty nice collection in their
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes">Pelican Themes Repo</a>, which is where I found this one (attributed in the
footer).</p>
<p>The other thing was the directory layout just seems more “me”. I know that sounds
dumb, but I’m a believer in picking tools that fit your style, assuming the
technical merits are all the same. This was most certainly a case of that.</p>
<p>Not much else to report, just wanted to get the traditional “hello world” post
out there...</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="publishing-a-zenoss-zenpack-to-pypi-using-travis-ci">
<h1>Publishing A Zenoss ZenPack to PyPi Using Travis-CI</h1>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It was pointed out to me that while ZenPacks are technically eggs,
it is not always safe to promote them as a standard Python module, which is
why you don’t see more ZenPacks on PyPi.</p>
<p class="last">So read on if you are curious about how it <em>might</em> work, but please don’t
make this part of your standard ZenPack release process.</p>
</div>
<p>I recently had the need to update the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ZCA/ZenPacks.community.f5">F5 ZenPack</a>. It had been a while since
I had updated a Pack so I was hopeful that the process for releasing a new
pack (<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.zenoss.org/Releasing_your_ZenPack">http://wiki.zenoss.org/Releasing_your_ZenPack</a>) had been updated to be
a little less manual. Don’t get me wrong the system that is in place is a vast
improvement of what used to exist, but I’m just not excited about how manual
the process is. Maybe I’ll write up a seperate page about what I dislike about
the process, but the focus on this page is not to complain about that process,
but rather show what I think is a better (more automatted) solution.</p>
<p>So the goal I set out was with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I didn’t want to continue to maintain two different versions of documentation
(I keep a README.rst with the pack, but the Wiki requires wiki markup)</li>
<li>I didn’t want to manually upload any build artifacts</li>
<li>I want to lay the ground work for some testing (I’ve historically done a poor
job at adding tests to my ZenPacks, but I’m hoping to change that)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I set out on the road of using <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> uploading <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org">PyPi</a>. So the first
step I took was getting integration with PyPi`_ outside of Travis. After reading
up on the documentation at <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/3/distutils/packageindex.html">http://docs.python.org/3/distutils/packageindex.html</a></p>
<p>I added the following release.sh script to my ZenPacks repo:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>#! /bin/bash

# Create a .pypirc file in the home directory
echo &quot;[distutils]
index-servers =
        pypi

[pypi]&quot; &gt; ~/.pypirc

echo &quot;username: &quot; &quot;$PYPI_USER&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.pypirc
echo &quot;password: &quot; &quot;$PYPI_PWD&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.pypirc

python setup.py sdist bdist_egg upload
rm -f ~/.pypirc</pre>
</div>
<p>So what this does is read in my PyPi username and password from an environment
variable so I don’t need to keep them in the repo. Additionally if someone else
ever wants to become a contributor it should allow them to use the same script</p>
<p>I did a one time registration of the ZenPack outside of this script, and from
there on out, I’m able to just run <cite>sh release.sh</cite> from the root of the repo
and it will upload the compile compile egg (which contains the version) to PyPi.</p>
<p>So right out of the gate, I’ve hit two of my three targets. But I wanted to take
it a little further. While running <cite>sh release.sh</cite> is pretty easy, I wanted
to see about automatically testing and upload the egg. This is where things
got a little trickier, but still not to bad...</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> getting started documentation is pretty indepth, so I don’t want
to recreate that here, but I do want to call out you’ll want to read up
how to do the encrypted environment stuff.</p>
<p>So after some trial and error (I’m not sure why, but it took me a while to krok
the encrypted environment variable stuff), I ended up with this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ZCA/ZenPacks.community.f5/blob/master/.travis.yml">.travis.yml</a>.</p>
<p>So now everytime I push a change up to the github repo, a service hook fires
and <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> starts building my ZenPack immediatly. You can see those build
resuts here: <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/ZCA/ZenPacks.community.f5">https://travis-ci.org/ZCA/ZenPacks.community.f5</a></p>
<p>As part of the build process it will produce two egg files, one for Python2.6
(Zenoss 3.x) and one for Python 2.7 (Zenoss 4.x), and upload them automatically
to <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org">PyPi</a>.</p>
<p>I do have to say, I was not 100% comfortable with the idea of handing over some
much private information to Travis (allowing them access to my GitHub account,
as well as trusting that their encryption keys are secure). In the end, I just
ensured I was using information I don’t use on any other sites. I still
can’t say I’m entirely comfortable with it, but sometimes you just have to be
a little trusting. We’ll see....</p>
<p>The process did go smooth enough, that I intend to convert some of the other
ZenPacks I maintain and see how it goes longer term.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="live-with-mynt">
<h1>Live With Mynt</h1>
<p>So I’ve been hearing a bit lately about static site generators. So the last couple of nights I decided to finally do a little homework and better understand it.</p>
<p>So after reading about the various options out there I ended up experimenting with several of the available Python options (Mynt, Pelican, Nikola, and Hyde). I went with Python, as I am primarily a Windows users and I’ve always had an easier time getting Python packages working on Windows than Ruby (which is why I kept looking despite Jekyll being so popular).</p>
<p>I was not overwhelmed by any of the offerings, and it was clear that these are not solutions for the “average” user. You need to small amount of technical skill to get any of them up and running and understand their template systems.</p>
<p>At the end of the day I decided to go with Mynt as it seemed to be most basic. Some of the others had more plugins and such, but for how rarely I do this, I don’t need much.</p>
<p>One of the other things I wanted to learn more about was using GitHub Pages for user pages. At worked I’ve played a fair amount with GH-Pages for project sites,  but since I’d never done a user page, I decided I’d host my personal site created with Mynt on my Github Personal Page. I’m not sure why, but I don’t really care for the way its implemented requiring you to understand git branches and what not, but I’ve grown used to it and have learned to tolerate it :).</p>
<p>One of the really cool things I found completely by accident during my digging was <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import">https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import/</a>. ghp-import makes it super easy to publish a directory of compiled content to a given Github branch. Once I figured this out the whole multiple branch thing becomes less annoying. So I configured my repo’s default branch to be <strong>source</strong>, leaving <strong>master</strong> as the place the compiled content would end up. Then I’m able to easily push with a simple one-liner:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>ghp-import _build -p -r origin -b master</pre>
</div>
<p>OK.... thats enough for now, back to the innerwebs to see what else I can learn</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="big-ip-ltm-ve-on-virtualbox">
<h1>BIG-IP LTM VE on VirtualBox</h1>
<p>I wanted to do some testing on a Zenoss BIG-IP ZenPack I wrote today, and I didn’t have the access to a test box that I had when I initially wrote it. So I decided I’d give the BIG-IP LTM VE a whirl.</p>
<p>I’m on a VirtualBox kick right now, but the appliance choices there don’t list VirtualBox. Inspired by this post, I figured I’d give it a shot since it looked simple enough. I’m re-documenting the process here, so I can just add a little more detail around this.</p>
<p>Start by registering (or signing in if you already have an account) via <a class="reference external" href="https://www.f5.com/trial/big-ip-ltm-virtual-edition.php">https://www.f5.com/trial/big-ip-ltm-virtual-edition.php</a>.</p>
<p>Navigate the screens to get your trial key, and subsequent download. You’ll want to grab the ESXi based ova file MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE 10.1 OVA. I thought I would be cool and download the 10.2 file. Turns out you can’t activate the 10.2 trial… How dumb… anyway save yourself some time and just download 10.1</p>
<p>From within the VirtualBox UI, select File –&gt; Import Appliance</p>
<p>Select Choose and locate the .ova file you just downloaded. Click Next</p>
<p>There are just a couple of settings you’ll want to tweak on Import Settings page:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Give your appliance a name (or just accept the default)</li>
<li>Change to 2 CPUs</li>
<li>Changes to 2048MB of RAM</li>
<li>Change the file extension on the virtual disk image to be a .vdi</li>
</ol>
<p>You should see a license agreement, agree to it of course.</p>
<p>One the import is complete, I’d suggest setting each network adaptor to host-only networking, unless you really need it to talk externally. Regardless of if you change that or not, power on the VM now.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is assign a management IP. Start by logging into the vm through the VirtualBox console. credentials are root/default. At the CLI type config. I opted let DHCP do its thing by answering Yes “use automatic configuration of ip address”</p>
<p>type ifconfig and you should see any entry like eth0:mgmt. This will give you the IP address of your management interface. Using https navigate to that IP addresses in a browser on your workstation. https://192.168.1.100 (or whatever IP you got). <strong>NOTE</strong> the username and password for the UI is different than the cli. Use admin/admin for logging into the webui</p>
<p>You’ll be prompted to run through a setup wizard. Its self explanatory enough that I don’t think I need to cover it here. From here you are on your own. Proceed as you see fit.</p>

<h1>Installing Varnish Cache 3.0.2 on Centos 5.7</h1>
<p>If you are here, you probably already know what Varnish is, but in case you don’t….https://www.varnish-cache.org/</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Varnish Cache is an open source, state of the art web application accelerator. It is installed in front of your webserver where it will
cache the content, resulting in a huge performance boost.</div></blockquote>
<p>Now that we’ve gotten that out of way, lets get to it. As is the case with most things I post, this is not intended to be an official “how-to” document, but rather a journal of my adventures in doing it. As should always be the case I’m starting with the supplied installation documentation located here: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/installation/install.html#centos-redhat">https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/installation/install.html#centos-redhat</a></p>
<p>Start with a vanilla minimal install of Centos 5.7. I did perform a ‘yum update’ &amp; ‘reboot’ after the initial installation of the OS, before starting with installing Varnish.</p>
<p>Lets create a repo file and leverage Varnish’s existing repo. We also need libedit out of EPEL, so enabling that repo as well. I suppose I could have just grabbed the single RPM just as easily…</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp
wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
rpm -i epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
rpm --nosignature -i http://repo.varnish-cache.org/redhat/varnish-3.0/el5/noarch/varnish-release-3.0-1.noarch.rpm
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Install Varnish and its various dependencies</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>yum -y install varnish
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Fire it up!</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>service varnish start
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Check that its alive (The 503 response code is expected right now)</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># curl -I http://localhost:6081</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That’s about it, doesn’t get much easier than that. Perhaps if I get more ambitious I’ll post some configuration tweaks and or cool tricks (if I learn any).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="installing-apache-traffic-server-3-0-1-on-centos-5-7">
<h1>Installing Apache Traffic Server 3.0.1 on Centos 5.7</h1>
<p>A quick chronicle of my journey to install Apache Traffic Servers on Centos 5.7. In the end it ended up being a lot easier than I was expecting, given how sporadic and incomplete the documentation on their site is.</p>
<p>Start with a vanilla minimal install of Centos 5.7. I did perform a ‘yum update’ &amp; ‘reboot’ after the initial installation of the OS, before starting with installing ATS</p>
<p>Do the installation:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp
wget http://www.carfab.com/apachesoftware//trafficserver/trafficserver-3.0.1.tar.bz2
yum -y install gcc gcc-c++ pcre pcre-devel tcl tcl-devel openssl-devel expat-devel
tar -jxvf trafficserver-3.0.1.tar.bz2
<span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp/trafficserver-3.0.1
./configure --prefix<span class="o">=</span>/opt/trafficserver
make
make install
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point it was installed for me, however I ran into one <em>really</em> boneheaded mistake. Mostly my own fault, but the documentation in the getting started guide is misleading as well. From this page <a class="reference external" href="http://trafficserver.apache.org/docs/v2/admin/getstart.htm">http://trafficserver.apache.org/docs/v2/admin/getstart.htm</a> it says:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log on to the Traffic Server node as the Traffic Server administrator and navigate to the Traffic Server bin directory.</li>
<li>Enter the following command:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>./start_traffic_server
./trafficserver start
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The problem is that start_traffic_server does not exist. Since I’m brand new to traffic server, I can’t be sure, but I suspect this is a relic from 2.x. The next challenge was running “./trafficserver start”. This gives the illusion that the server has started, but I ran into issues with traffic_line and traffic_shell errors. You can see the details of those errors in my semi-embarrassing forum post here: <a class="reference external" href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/trafficserver-users/201111.mbox/browser">http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/trafficserver-users/201111.mbox/browser</a></p>
<p>For those that want to cut to the chase, start traffic server with “trafficserver start” notice the omission of the underscore. Running this command also starts traffic_cop and traffic_manager. I ended up finding this by reading the INSTALL file that was included in the source download. Yes, I did read the file before attempting to install, but as I already admitted, glossed right over the closely named file.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="template-generated-array-in-velocity">
<h1>Template Generated Array in Velocity</h1>
<p>Today I was trying to do something in a velocity template that I found to be a little
harder than I would have guessed. I was trying to manually generate an array from within my template.
I had a single template that I needed to wrap some super crude IP checking around. I have a couple of
ip addresses which are allowed to see the template code, but everyone else should get the boot.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t write a lot of code, let alone Velocity code, so I figured I’d hit up the
user documentation for Velocity: <a class="reference external" href="http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.htm">http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.htm</a>.
Would you believe I found nothing of the sorts? I found how to loop through an existing array,
but nothing on creating a new one from within the template.</p>
<p>Well, after some googling I found a few newsgroup posts. I wanted to capture the syntax here,
as it was incredibly easy. And just as if you had been provided the array from underlying java code
you can loop through your template generated array.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#set($AllowedIPs= [&quot;1.1.1.1&quot;,&quot;2.2.2.2&quot;])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Thats it. I couldn’t believe it took me more than 30 seconds to find this :(. In any event
if anyone is curious the code looks a bit like the following.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The system on which the code is running, provides access to
a variable, $remoteIPAddress, which is the client IP. Without that provided variable this will of
course not work:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#set($AllowedIPs= [&quot;1.1.1.1&quot;,&quot;2.2.2.2&quot;])</span>
<span class="c">#foreach($IpAddress in $AllowedIPs)</span>
   <span class="c">#if($remoteIPAddress eq $IpAddress)</span>
      <span class="c">## Do Whatever you need in here, and it will only happen</span>
      <span class="c">## For authorized IP addresses</span>
   <span class="c">#end</span>
<span class="c">#end</span>
</pre></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="sending-an-smtp-email-in-python-3">
<h1>Sending an SMTP email in Python 3</h1>
<p>This took me far longer than it should have, and while I’d like to blame shotty documentation and sparse examples it was probably my own stupidity causing the issue. Whatever the case maybe I wanted to jot down my results as I’m sure I’ll need to do this again.</p>
<p>I’d like go on a rant about how much harder this was than it should be and how an easier module should exist. However, the fact that I can’t write an easier module lends itself to the “Don’t Complain, Contribute” motto, so I’ll settle on the belief that its not easier for a good reason, and maybe one day if I ever get really good at Python I can make it easier.</p>
<p>For the time challenged people who don’t want to read, here is the condensed version with no explanation:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>import smtplib
import string

subject = &quot;My Wicked Cool Subject Line&quot;
to = &quot;rec1@domain1.com,rec2@domain.com&quot;.split(&quot;,&quot;)
from = &quot;sender@domain.com&quot;
body_text = &quot;Enter the contents of your body here&quot;
body = &quot;From: {0} \r\n \
        To: {1} \r\n \
        Subject: {2} \r\n \
        {3} \r\n&quot;.format(FROM, &quot;, &quot;.join(TO), SUBJECT, text)
server = smtplib.SMTP(&quot;YourSMTPServerName&quot;,YourSMTPServerPort)
server.login(&quot;you@yourdomain.com&quot;,&quot;yourpassword&quot;)
server.set_debuglevel(1)
server.sendmail(from, to, body)
server.quit()</pre>
</div>
<p>For those that want a little more explanation, aside from reading the python docs, I’ve added some quick notes around some of the stuff that is not uber obvious. So the first thing we need is the SMTP module:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">smtplib</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then we’ll need the string module. Quite likely there are other ways to accomplish this, but this is the method I took:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">string</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The following is using some variables to over-simplify the whole mess, but you should get the idea:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>subject = &quot;My Wicked Cool Subject Line&quot;
#add as many as you need separated by commas
to = &quot;rec1@domain1.com,rec2@domain.com&quot;.split(&quot;,&quot;)
from = &quot;sender@domain.com&quot;
#obviously you can dynamically generate this variable.
body_text = &quot;Enter the contents of your body here&quot;
#didn't bother to read all the gory details, but from what I gather
# This approach is used to set some SMTP headers, and munch everything
# into a single body entity.
body = &quot;From: {0} \r\n \
        To: {1} \r\n \
        Subject: {2} \r\n \
        {3} \r\n&quot;.format(FROM, &quot;, &quot;.join(TO), SUBJECT, text)

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="section" id="cloud-zoom-is-blocking-my-modal-dialog-box">
<h1>Cloud Zoom Is Blocking My Modal Dialog Box</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I’ve got a page that is using a few different jQuery dependent features/functions.</li>
<li>I’m using the superfish drop down menu</li>
<li>I’m also using the jQuery UI Dialog for a modal dialog box</li>
<li>And finally, I’m using Cloud Zoom for some image excitement</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue I was having is that the Cloud Zoom enhanced image was being displayed in front of my drop down
menu as well as my modal dialog box. At first I had only noticed the issue on the drop menu, and was having
a hard time figuring out what was going on, and thought perhaps I had done something wrong on the superfish menu.
Once I noticed it was also affecting my modal dialog, I became suspicious of cloud zoom.</p>
<p>I went through and tried a few different things, and finally just disabled cloud zoom.
At that point my drop down menu was now correctly displayed over top of the image.
I spent some time looking through the cloud-zoom site with no luck. I spent quite a bit of time googling with no luck.</p>
<p>I turned my attention to the jQuery UI documentation for anything that might be a clue.
I was reading through the various options and came upon the zIndex option. I had no idea what zIndex was (I am no jQuery expert).
Long story short, I finally got to this article: <a class="reference external" href="http://zenverse.net/how-to-fix-superfish-dropdown-menu-that-appear-under-floating-divs-in-ie6">http://zenverse.net/how-to-fix-superfish-dropdown-menu-that-appear-under-floating-divs-in-ie6/</a>
So I randomly picked a stupid high zIndex (100,000), and sure enough it worked! So the question of the day is WHY?
and what is the value of zIndex I need to use? Well on a hunch I started digging through the cloud zoom javascript and found line 350:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$(this).wrap('&lt;div id=&quot;wrap&quot; style=&quot;top:0px;z-index:9999;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');</pre>
</div>
<p>So Cloud Zoom is using 9999. Any other components that has a z-index lower than that will be displayed behind my images.
So of course, I put this to the test. I set my z-index to 10,000 on my menu and 10,001 on my modal dialog.</p>
<p>A quick refresh and everything is working perfect!. zIndex... who knew...</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, yes I did test an iteration with the index of the menu and modal dialog set to be lower
than 9999 and as expected they were hidden by the cloud zoom image.</p>
